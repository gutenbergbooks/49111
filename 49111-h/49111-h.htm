<p>A great Emperor once
asked one of his noble
subjects what would secure
his country the first place
among the nations of the
earth. The nobleman's
grand reply was "Good
mothers." Now, what constitutes
a good mother?
The answer is conclusive.
She who, regarding the future
welfare of her child,
seeks every available means
that may offer to promote a sound physical development, to the
end that her offspring may not be deficient in any single faculty
with which nature has endowed it. In infancy there is no period
which is more likely to affect the future disposition of the child
than that of teething, producing as it does fretfulness, moroseness
of mind, etc., which if not checked will manifest itself in after days.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>All the clocks of the great, thronged city clanged out the hour
of midnight from their hoarse, brazen throats simultaneously, and
as the last tremulous echo died away on the air, a human soul that
had wasted its glorious talents, and squandered its heritage of genius
in a reckless, dissipated life, was launched out on the great, shoreless
tide of eternity.</p>

<p>And in the same moment of time a young, fair, innocent girl, the
dead man's only child, was cast adrift, friendless and forlorn, upon
the mercies of the cold, hard world.</p>

<p>She fell, like one dead, by the bedside, and the wealth of her burnished
golden hair fell like a pitying veil over the slender form that
had bent like a flower before the relentless blast of fate.</p>

<p>The coarse, but not unkindly, lodging house people bore her into
her own little room, and left her there alone to recover, while they
prepared the dead man for burial to-morrow.</p>

<p>It was but a little while that this blessed unconsciousness lasted,
when Laurel Vane struggled up to her feet to push back with little,
trembling hands the cloud of golden hair from her white brow, and
stare with great, frightened, somber eyes out into the strange, unknown
future.</p>

<p>What terrible temptation, what love and sorrow and bitter despair
that future held in its keeping for her was yet mercifully hidden
from her sight by the thick curtain of mystery that ever hides To-morrow
from our curious eyes.</p>

<p>The daughter of a genius, who had beclouded his gifted brain
with the fumes of strong drink, and who had only written his brilliant
articles under the stress of compulsion, and to keep the wolf
from the door, the girl realized that she was left alone and penniless,
with not a friend to pity or protect her. It came over her suddenly,
and with a great thrill of horror, that her father's last article&mdash;finished
only yesterday, before that sudden illness laid its chilly,
fatal hand upon him&mdash;must be carried to the publishing house and
the money received therefor before she could bury her dead!</p>

<p>Her dead! She could scarcely realize that her fond, though
erring father, the profound scholar, the erratic genius who had loved
his little girl even while he had unpardonably neglected her, was
gone from her for evermore. With trembling footsteps she glided
to the room where the people, having robed him for the grave, had
left him alone in the solemn majesty of death.</p>

<p>A terrible shudder shook her frame as she beheld that sheeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<i>something</i> lying in stiff, rigid outline upon the narrow bed. Half
frightened, she drew back the snowy linen and gazed upon the handsome,
marble-white features, to whose pallid grace death had added
a solemn dignity all its own.</p>

<p>Great bursting sobs of regret and sorrow shook the daughter's
frame as she gazed on that loved face, where in life the stamp of
genius had been marred by the traces of dissipation and vulgar pleasures.
Laurel was little more than a child, yet she knew that her
father had recklessly wasted his God-given talents and sated his soul
on the dry husks of life. Yet in all her sorrow and pity, in all her
fear of the untried future, no thought of anger or blame came to her
as she kept her sorrowful vigil by his side. There were others who
blamed him that he had left this tender flower, his "Laurel blossom,"
as he poetically called her, alone and penniless in the hard,
cold world. But she, his daughter, had nothing but tears and love
for him now when he lay before her dead.</p>

<p>In a few hours they would carry him away, her beloved, forever
out of her sight, but even those last few hours she could not have to
spend with him. She was too forlorn and poor to give herself these
last moments with him. She must carry his last manuscript to the
office and receive the money before she could pay for his coffin and
hearse. And already the lodging-house keepers were adjuring her
to hasten in burying him. It was so gloomy having a corpse in the
house, they said, unfeelingly.</p>

<p>So, at the earliest office hours, Laurel presented herself at the editor's
desk with the small roll of manuscript clasped tightly in her
little black gloved hand.</p>

<p>The clerk stared almost rudely at the young face from which she
put aside the shielding veil with one timid hand.</p>

<p>"A little beauty, if only she weren't so pale and tear-stained,"
was his mental comment.</p>

<p>"I have brought Mr. Vane's article for the magazine. Can I
have the money for it now?" she asked, falteringly.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, but the editor isn't in. You may leave the paper,
and Mr. Vane can call for his money later in the day," replied the
clerk, devouring her sweet face with his bold, admiring eyes.</p>

<p>The red mouth trembled, the wide, somber dark eyes brimmed
over with quick tears.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he cannot come&mdash;he is dead!" she answered in uneven
tones, "and," flushing crimson in a sensitive shame at her own poverty,
"I must have the money to bury him!"</p>

<p>"Ah, dead? Very sorry, I'm sure," said the clerk, a little startled
out of his coolness; "and you are his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Laurel Vane."</p>

<p>"The editor doesn't come down to his office till noon. He always
examines articles and pays for them himself. Very sorry your father
is dead&mdash;a fine writer when he chose to take up the pen. Can I do
anything else for you, Miss Vane?" went on the bold-eyed young
man, rather pitying her sorrow and timidity, inasmuch as she was
fair to look upon.</p>

<p>"If you will give me the address I will go to Mr. Gordon's
private residence. I must have the money without delay," she answered,
faintly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>He scribbled the address on a card for her, and after bowing her
out in his most killing air, he went back to tell the printers that
"old Vane had drunk himself to death at last, and left a devilish
pretty little daughter without a penny."</p>

<p>"With a name as pretty as her face&mdash;Laurel Vane!" he added.</p>

<p>"He might have had a prouder laurel for his brow than a penniless
daughter if he had not been so fond of his glass," said the printers,
grimly.</p>

<p>And this was Louis Vane's epitaph.</p>

<p>While Laurel directed her faltering steps to the editor's up-town
residence, all unconscious that the finger of Fate was pointing the
way.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon was one of the most successful editors and publishers
of the day, and his brown-stone house on one of the fashionable
avenues of the great city looked like a palace to Laurel's unaccustomed
eyes. She went slowly up the broad steps and rang the bell
a little nervously, feeling her courage desert her at thought of the
interview with the stern editor. No thought came to her that her
first meeting with that august personage would be in a darker, more
fateful hour than this.</p>

<p>The smart serving-man who opened the door stared at our simply
clad heroine a little superciliously. He could not recognize a lady
apart from a fine dress.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Gordon, please," Laurel said, with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gordon is out, mem," was the disappointing reply.</p>

<p>"Where is he gone? When will he come back?" exclaimed
Laurel, in piteous disappointment.</p>

<p>"He's gone into the country, and he won't be back until to-night,"
was the concise reply.</p>

<p>The day was warm, but the girl shivered as if the ground had
been swept from beneath her feet by the icy blast of winter. An
unconscious cry broke from her quivering lips, and she clasped her
little hands tightly together.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do now?" she moaned, despairingly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, mem," said the man impudently, and
making an impatient move to shut the door in her face.</p>

<p>He might have done so with impunity, for Laurel, gazing before
her with dazed, despairing gaze, was for the moment incapable of
speech or action, but at that moment a door opened sharply on the
side of the hall, a swish of silk sounded softly, and a clear, sweet
voice inquired:</p>

<p>"Who is that asking for papa, Charles?"</p>

<p>Charles opened the door and fell back obsequiously. A lovely
blue-eyed girl, richly dressed, came toward Laurel.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Gordon's daughter. Is your business important?"
she inquired with girlish curiosity.</p>

<p>She thought she had never seen anything so sweet and sad as the
dark, wistful eyes Laurel flashed upward to meet her gaze.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, it is very important," she faltered, incoherently.
"Perhaps you could&mdash;that is, if you would&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Gordon smiled a little at the tripping speech, but not unkindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in. I will do what I can," she said, and led Laurel past
the discomfited Charles into a lovely little anteroom, with flowers
and books and pictures, that made it a little feminine paradise.</p>

<p>She pushed a little cushioned blue-satin chair toward Laurel.</p>

<p>"Sit down and tell me what you want of papa," she said, gently;
and Laurel's impulsive heart went out in a great flood of gratitude
to this beautiful stranger who looked and spoke so sweetly.</p>

<p>She grasped the back of the chair tightly with both hands, and
turned her dark, beseeching eyes on Miss Gordon's face.</p>

<p>"I have brought Mr. Vane's manuscript for the magazine," she
added. "He&mdash;my papa&mdash;is dead," she added, with a rush of bitter
tears, "and we are so poor I must have the money to pay for his
funeral."</p>

<p>Instantly Beatrix Gordon drew out her dainty pearl <i>port-monnaie</i>.
"You poor child!" she said, compassionately. "What is the price
of the article?"</p>

<p>Laurel named it, and Miss Gordon counted the money out into the
little trembling hand, and received the manuscript.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry Mr. Vane is dead," she said. "He was a very
gifted writer. Has he left you all alone, my poor girl?" with gentle
compassion.</p>

<p>"All alone," Laurel echoed, drearily.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she caught Miss Gordon's hand, and covered it
with tears and kisses.</p>

<p>"You have been so kind and so noble to me, that I will do anything
on earth for you, Miss Gordon," she sobbed out, gratefully.</p>

<p>Then she hurried away to bury her dead, little thinking in what
way Beatrix Gordon would claim her promise.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>"Come in," said Laurel, faintly, in answer to the sharp rap at
the door.</p>

<p>The cheap, plain funeral was over, and the orphan sat alone in the
deepening twilight in the shabby little room, now invested with a
somber dignity all its own since the presence of death had so lately
been there.</p>

<p>Laurel's head was bowed upon her hands, and tears coursed
slowly, each one a scalding drop of woe, down her white cheeks.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the woman from whom Mr. Vane had
rented the two shabby little rooms entered abruptly. She was a
coarse, hard-featured creature, devoid of sympathy or sensibility.
She looked coldly at the weeping girl.</p>

<p>"The rent's due to-day, Miss Vane," she said, roughly. "Have
you got the money to pay it?"</p>

<p>Laurel silently counted over the contents of her slim purse.</p>

<p>"Here is the money, Mrs. Groves, and it is the last cent I have on
earth," she said, drearily, as she placed the silver in the woman's
greedy outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Then of course you'll not be wanting the rooms any
longer. I will trouble you to move out early in the morning, so's I
may rent them to somebody else," exclaimed Mrs. Groves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Laurel sprung to her feet in dismay, a terrified look on her fair
young face.</p>

<p>"Oh, madam, I have nowhere to go&mdash;so soon!" she cried out
pleadingly. "Perhaps you will let me keep the one little room
until I can find work. I will be sure to pay you!"</p>

<p>"I can't depend on no such uncertain prospects," declared Mrs.
Groves, unfeelingly. "I've got to be pretty certain where my
money's coming from before I rent my rooms. So out you go in
the morning, and if you don't leave quietly I'll have your trunk
hoisted out on the sidewalk in a jiffy, so there!"</p>

<p>With this emphatic threat the rude landlady banged herself out of
the room, and Laurel sunk down with a low moan of terror upon
the floor.</p>

<p>She was no coward, reader, this forlorn little heroine of ours, but
she knew scarcely more of the wide world outside her cheap lodging-house
than a baby. She had lived in one poor place or another
with her erratic father all her life, keeping their poor little rooms
with untaught skill, meagerly supported by his neglected talent, and
with not an idea of how to earn her own living. Mr. Vane had
educated her after his own desultory fashion, but not in a practical
way that she could utilize now in her need. She wondered with a
shudder of dread what she should do, and where she should go to-morrow
when she was turned out into the streets, of which she felt
horribly afraid, and which her father had seldom permitted her to
traverse alone.</p>

<p>She pushed open the casement and looked out. Night had fallen,
and under the glare of the gaslight Laurel saw wicked men and
ribald women tramping the streets. To-morrow night she would be
out on the horrible pavements among them, with nowhere to go, and
not a friend in all the wide, wicked city. Perhaps they would murder
her, these wolves of the street, when she was cast out like a
helpless white lamb astray from the fold.</p>

<p>Shivering, she recalled some verses she had somewhere read. They
seemed to fit her own forlorn strait.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where the lamps quiver<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So far in the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With many a light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From window and casement,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From garret to basement,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She stood with amazement,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Houseless by night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" she moaned, tremblingly. "It were a
thousand times better, papa, if I had died with you."</p>

<p>The room door opened suddenly and without warning, and Mrs.
Groves reappeared.</p>

<p>"Here's a young man asking for you, Miss Vane. P'r'aps he'll
tell you how to make a honest living now your pa's dead," she said,
with a coarse, significant chuckle.</p>

<p>She hustled the visitor across the threshold, and, closing the door,
stumped loudly down the passage, but returned in a moment on tip-toe,
to play the eavesdropper.</p>

<p>The room was all in darkness save for the gaslight that streamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
through the open window. Laurel turned quickly to light her little
lamp, wondering who her visitor might be.</p>

<p>To her amazement she saw the rather good-looking and bold-eyed
clerk she had met at the publishing-house that morning.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Vane," he said, insinuatingly. "I ventured
to call, thinking that you might need a friend."</p>

<p>The quick instinct of purity took alarm in Laurel's breast. She
drew back coldly as he offered her his smooth, white hand.</p>

<p>"I needed a friend this morning, but you did not seem to remember
it then," she said, scathingly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ah&mdash;oh, I was taken by surprise, then. I had not my wits
about me," he stammered, disconcerted. "Pray pardon my forgetfulness.
I have been thinking about you all day, and wishing I
could help you. Here is my card. Pray command my services."</p>

<p>Laurel took the bit of gilt-edged pasteboard, and read the name
written on it in smooth copper-plate. It was</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Ross Powell</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>The young man had seated himself, meanwhile, with the coolest
self-possession. Laurel looked at him with her great, wistful, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean what you say?" she inquired, a faint ring
of hope in her dejected voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. I infer that your father has left you without means of
support, and I wish to offer you a good situation," Mr. Powell replied,
suavely, with a sparkle in his bold gray eyes.</p>

<p>The girl clasped her little hands impulsively together. Hope and
fear struggled together on her fair young face.</p>

<p>"But I don't know how to do anything," she cried, ingenuously.
"I have never been to school like other girls. I've always kept
papa's rooms and mended his clothes, and made my own dresses,
but I couldn't do anything like that well enough for any one else."</p>

<p>Ross Powell's gray eyes sparkled wickedly. He kept the lids
drooped over them, that Laurel might not see their evil gleam.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you could!" he exclaimed. "I know some one who
wants a little housekeeper just like you, to keep two beautiful rooms
in order as you did for your father. Will you come, Laurel?"</p>

<p>"Who is the person?" she inquired, flushing sensitively at his
familiar utterance of her name.</p>

<p>Ross Powell moved his chair to Laurel's side, and gazed deep into
her beautiful, wondering dark eyes.</p>

<p>"The person is myself," he replied, in low, lover-like tones. "I
have fallen in love with you, my beautiful little Laurel, and I want
you to come and be my little fairy housekeeper. I will love and
cherish you as the darling of my heart."</p>

<p>Laurel regarded him a moment in blank silence. There was a
look of genuine perplexity on her innocent face.</p>

<p>She spoke at length in a low, doubtful tone.</p>

<p>"Are you asking me to be your wife, sir?" was her <i>naïve</i> question.</p>

<p>He flushed and looked rather abashed at the innocent question.</p>

<p>"Why, no, my dear, not exactly," he answered, regaining his
self-possession in a moment. "I don't wish to saddle myself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
a wife yet; but it would be about the same thing. I would worship
you, my beautiful Laurel, and you should have fine dresses and
jewels, visit the theaters and operas, live in beautiful rooms; while
I, your adoring slave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, Ross Powell!"</p>

<p>She had stood like one turned to stone, gazing and listening for a
moment; but now her young voice rang like a clarion through the
room: "Stop, Ross Powell!"</p>

<p>He sprung from his seat, and moving to her side attempted to
take her hand. She tore it from him and struck him an ignominious
slap in the face with that small white member. Her eyes blazed,
her cheeks burned.</p>

<p>She crossed to the door, and threw it open so suddenly that Mrs.
Groves was disclosed in the act of listening, but Laurel paid no
heed to her as she shuffled away, crestfallen, and for once ashamed
of herself.</p>

<p>The flashing eyes of the girl seemed to wither the villain where he
stood gazing sullenly upon her, with the red mark of that frantic
blow upon his face.</p>

<p>"Go, Ross Powell," she said, pointing a disdainful finger at him.
"Go, and may the good God in heaven punish you doubly and trebly
for this dastardly outrage on an unprotected girl!"</p>

<p>He slunk across the threshold like the base, evil-hearted coward
that he was, but out in the narrow passage he turned and looked
back at her with a malevolent glare on his crimson-marked face.</p>

<p>"You have made an enemy, Laurel Vane," he hissed. "I would
have given you love and protection, but you have chosen my hatred
instead. I shall not forget you. I shall always remember that blow
in my face, and I shall have my revenge for it. Look well to your
future, my beautiful fury!"</p>

<p>Laurel slammed and locked the door in the face of the angry
wretch, and fell upon the floor again, giving vent to her outraged
feelings in a storm of passionate tears.</p>

<p>But it seemed as though she were not destined to have any peace
or quiet that evening. Again a rap sounded on the door.</p>

<p>She brushed away her falling tears and opened it in fear and
trembling.</p>

<p>A smart, pretty girl was her visitor this time.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Gordon's maid," said the newcomer, and she slipped
a perfumed little envelope into Laurel's hand.</p>

<p>Laurel opened it and read, with bewildered eyes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear little Laurel</span>,&mdash;I wish to see you very much, but
there are reasons why I cannot come to you, so I have sent my maid,
Clarice, to bring you to me. I have been thinking of you all day,
and of your sweet promise to do anything on earth for me. I believe
that we can mutually help each other. Come quickly, dear.
Have no fear but that Clarice will guide you safely to me.</p>

<p class="sig0">"Your friend,</p>
<p class="sig1">"<span class="smcap">Beatrix Gordon</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Will you come, Miss Vane?" asked the pretty maid intelligently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," Laurel answered, hopefully, and so went forth to her
future.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>One of the most magnificent of the many palace homes that adorn
the glorious Hudson River belonged to St. Leon Le Roy.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, picturesque structure with graceful towers,
projecting oriel windows, charming balconies, and marble steps that
led down into spacious grounds so beautifully laid out that one
never wearied of the miniature lakes, the sparkling fountains, the
splendid shrubbery, the rare flowers, and the costly statuary that
dotted the velvety green lawns that sloped down to the water's edge.
It was a miniature paradise without, and the interior of the dwelling
was no less beautiful and tasteful. Cultured taste and rare refinement
had united with great wealth to make it a complete and perfect
ideal of a home. Perhaps the first St. Leon Le Roy, when he
had built this beautiful home and carried his blooming bride there,
had not been far wrong when he called it "Eden."</p>

<p>Whether he had found it a veritable Eden mattered little to him
now. He had passed to his rest in "the land that is fairer than
day," and his son reigned in his stead, a king by right of his imperious
will, and worshiped blindly by the queen-dowager his mother.</p>

<p>He was tall, dark, and stately, with an almost godlike beauty
marred somewhat by an expression of cynicism, coldness, and pride,
all curiously blended together. He was past the prime of youth,
being about five-and-thirty, and his varied experience of men and
things had left cold, distrustful lines about his firm, mustached
lips, and a mocking light in his proud dark eyes.</p>

<p>An impatient discontent rested on his handsome features as he sat
in a beautiful morning-room with his mother the second day after
the beginning of this story. The handsome, richly dressed old lady
was reading aloud from a letter that had just been received with the
morning's mail:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Le Roy</span>,&mdash;I am in a dilemma, and I turn to
you, my old friend, although I have not seen you in many years,
believing that you will aid and abet me in my innocent scheme.
My daughter, Beatrix, has formed a foolish engagement with a
young man of small income and no prospects. She is both beautiful
and accomplished, and as the sole heiress of her father's wealth
I cannot endure to see her become the prey of a designing fortune-hunter.
My plan is to separate them by sending Beatrix away from
the city and getting rid of her lover by some clever scheme before
she returns. If possible, Mr. Gordon will have him sent to Europe
(I would like to send the wretch to Kamtchatka if I could!) on some
lucrative mission. Both our hearts are deeply set on this plan. Indeed,
delicate invalid as I am, my nerves are so unstrung by this
affair, that I feel I shall perish unless I can rescue my child from
this undesirable entanglement. And now, dear Mrs. Le Roy, for
your share in our little scheme. I know that during the absence of
your son in Europe, you are leading a quiet, retired life, at your
beautiful home on the Hudson. I wish to have Beatrix visit you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for a few months, while we get her obnoxious lover out of the way
for good. So sure am I of your consent, that I have pretended to
Beatrix that you have already invited her, and on the day after to-morrow
I shall send her down to Eden in care of her maid. I would
accompany her myself, only that I am a confirmed invalid. My
dear friend, you must take the best care of my treasure. See that
she sends no letters to any one but her father or me. Allow no
stranger to visit her. I depend hopefully on your co-operation in
this matter, for my daughter is a fitting mate for the best, and I will
not sacrifice her to a poor man. You will pardon my prolix letter,
for the sake of a mother's anxiety.</p>

<p class="sig0">"Yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">"<span class="smcap">Isabel Gordon</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>She closed the letter and looked up at St. Leon, who stood in
the embrasure of a lace-draped window gazing carelessly out at the
beautiful grounds. A mocking sneer curled his thin lips as he returned
to her.</p>

<p>"A scheming woman of the world," he said, sententiously. "I
hope you will not lend yourself to her iniquitous plan."</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy glanced at her letter again.</p>

<p>"You see she really gives me no chance for refusing, simply taking
my consent for granted," she said, dubiously.</p>

<p>"No matter. Write her that you cannot receive Miss Beatrix. Tell
her I came home yesterday, and that I am an ogre who would
frighten her beauty away. What! is all the peace of my home-coming
to be marred by the coming of a romantic love-sick girl?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I will write her not to come, then, St. Leon&mdash;but, heavens, look
at the date of this letter! It has miscarried! She should be here to-day!"
exclaimed the lady nervously.</p>

<p>"Telegraph her, then&mdash;anything&mdash;only keep the girl away!" exclaimed
Le Roy, testily.</p>

<p>"I will do so immediately, St. Leon," exclaimed his mother, all
in a flutter that was quite unusual to her high-bred dignity.</p>

<p>But "fate is above us all!" At this moment a trained obsequious
servant opened the door, and announced respectfully:</p>

<p>"<i>Miss Gordon</i>."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>The agitated lady and her haughty, handsome son both looked at
the door with an irrepressible start.</p>

<p>A sixteen year old girl was wavering on the threshold, staring
into the elegant room and at the cold, curious faces of the mother
and son with parted lips, and large, somber, frightened dark eyes.
Over the simple, short traveling dress, of plain, dark-gray material,
her rich, burnished golden hair flowed in billows of brightness beneath
the wide brim of her simple hat. A neat pretty maid hovered
in the background, looking far more cool and self-possessed than
her lovely young mistress.</p>

<p>St. Leon Le Roy's quick eyes caught and held for a moment the
gaze of those startled ones. He saw a pale, pure face, exquisitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
molded, with perfect features, save, as he said to himself, her nose
was a trifle too short, and her lips too full. But then the defect of
her nose lent character to her face, and the pouting lips showed
tenderness. "A baby face," he said to himself, disdainfully, noting
the quiver of the lips, that trembled like a child's about to cry.</p>

<p>The girl's dark eyes turned quickly from that haughty, handsome
face as if in fear, and sought comfort in the woman's, but it was
cold and haughty too. There was no welcome on it save what cold,
conventional courtesy required. She advanced and gave the newcomer
the tips of her fingers and the side of her cheek to kiss.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Eden, Miss Gordon," she said, chillingly, and
then she led her up to her son. "Allow me to present my son, St.
Leon. He only returned from Europe yesterday," she added.</p>

<p>They bowed to each other with chill courtesy, these two, and that
was all. He was too annoyed at her coming to be ordinarily civil,
and she was too frightened at her grave, stern-looking host to put
out her little mite of a hand to him.</p>

<p>"You have quite surprised me, Beatrix&mdash;I suppose I must call
you Beatrix," said Mrs. Le Roy, trying to infuse some warmth into
her frigid manner. "You see, your mamma's letter miscarried,
and I have but just received it, so you must excuse my not sending
the carriage to meet you."</p>

<p>"Certainly," Beatrix murmured, coloring warmly for a moment,
and veiling her splendid eyes beneath their long fringed lashes,
while a sigh of relief escaped her lips as her hostess continued:</p>

<p>"I dare say you would like to be shown your room now, that you
may remove the dust of travel. It is very unpleasant, taking a journey
this warm weather."</p>

<p>Beatrix agreed with her, and when she had herself conducted her
and the maid Clarice to a lovely suite of rooms, all silver and azure,
Mrs. Le Roy returned to her son.</p>

<p>He still stood in the embrasure of the window, pulling his dark
mustache rather sulkily with his slender brown fingers.</p>

<p>"Was there ever such a <i>contretemps</i>!" she exclaimed, going up
to him. "What shall we do, St. Leon?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered, rather shortly.</p>

<p>"Nothing?" she echoed, helplessly, yet with an accent of relief
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Why, what is there to do?" he inquired, impatiently. "She is
here, whether we want her or not. We are not barbarians; we
cannot send our guest away. Besides, I have changed my mind;
Mrs. Gordon was right."</p>

<p>"Right!" she echoed, gazing up into his face inquiringly.</p>

<p>"My lady-mamma, has our guest quite upset your equanimity?"
he inquired, smiling down at her perturbed face. "You echo my
words with parrot-like pertinacity!"</p>

<p>"If I am disturbed, St. Leon, it is on your account," she replied,
with dignity. "I could endure the girl's visit very well myself."</p>

<p>"So can I, I think," he returned, musingly. "She is not at all
what my fancy painted her&mdash;a self-possessed fashionable beauty,
who would rather compel me to dance attendance upon her. I could
see that the little thing was rather afraid of me; I dare say she will
keep out of my way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it. She was positively shy and awkward.
Not at all like her mother, whom I remember as a brilliant belle who
held her own with queenly dignity," said Mrs. Le Roy. "I cannot
blame Isabel for her caution; Beatrix looks too young to have a
lover."</p>

<p>"'She's o'er young to marry yet,' certainly," assented her son.
"We will keep the ewe-lamb safe, mamma, and woe be to the wolf
that comes prowling around the precious fold."</p>

<p>He spoke so dryly that she could not tell whether he was in jest
or earnest, and his expression was just as inscrutable as his tone.
While she was puzzling over both, Beatrix returned.</p>

<p>Her plain gray traveling-dress had been exchanged for a pretty,
soft, white robe with delicate laces about it, and she carried a wide
sun hat in her small, dimpled hands.</p>

<p>The big dark eyes did not look quite so frightened now. They
looked yearningly out at the beautiful grounds.</p>

<p>"May I go out there?" she asked. "I have never seen such a
beautiful spot in my life before!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon looked at the girl as she made her timid request. Her
eyes drooped from his quickly, and the frightened look came into
them again.</p>

<p>He was unaccountably vexed, although a moment before he had
been pleased, because she was afraid of him.</p>

<p>"Why should the little goose fear me? I am not an ogre," he
said to himself, shortly, turning back to the window, while Mrs. Le
Roy answered politely:</p>

<p>"Certainly, child, and I will go with you to show you the way."</p>

<p>They went out together, and St. Leon watched them from the
window, appearing and disappearing among the winding walks,
the girl's white figure bending here and there among the gay <i>parterres</i>
of flowers, the morning sunshine lighting her waving tresses
into splendor. Mrs. Le Roy had given her <i>carte blanche</i> as to the
flowers, and she was eagerly filling her hands with the scented
beauties.</p>

<p>After a little, he remembered that his mother was growing old, and
that she must be weary of keeping pace with those light, quick footsteps.
He hesitated, and then went out to them.</p>

<p>"<i>Chère maman</i>, you must be tired," he said. "Sit down here on
this garden-seat and rest, and I will take your place with Miss Gordon."</p>

<p>Beatrix turned with quick compunction.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?" she said, looking at Mrs. Le Roy with the long,
curling lashes lifted from her expressive eyes. "I am so sorry. I
forgot that it isn't new to you as it is to me. Shall we go in?"</p>

<p>"By no means," answered the lady. "I will sit here and rest,
and St. Leon shall be your escort."</p>

<p>She flashed him a little glance, quickly withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you wouldn't like," she said.</p>

<p>He laughed, and walked on by her side by way of answer, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to himself that she was rather prettier than he had thought at
first. The wide sun-hat was tilted carelessly back from the fair
low brow with its childish fringe of sunny locks, and the dark eyes
with their long curling lashes looked darker still by contrast. A
soft color had come into her face, and shy smiles of pleasure hovered
around her lips. She looked like a child, with the front of her
white overskirt held up in her hands and filled with flowers.</p>

<p>"Do you like flowers?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"I <i>love</i> them," she answered, with a distinct emphasis on the
words. "I love them, and I never saw so many and such lovely
flowers as you have here."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to enjoy your visit to Eden," he said, pleased
at her pleasure in his home, and little thinking how she <i>would</i> enjoy
that visit&mdash;how all the joy and sorrow of her life would date from
these summer hours.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should enjoy it&mdash;I <i>know that</i>&mdash;only&mdash;only&mdash;" she said,
and paused in confusion.</p>

<p>"Only what? Tell me," said St. Leon Le Roy, thinking suddenly
of the lover from whom the girl had been torn by her scheming parents.</p>

<p>"She is thinking of that fortune hunter&mdash;that wretched entanglement,"
he said to himself, wondering what her next words
would be.</p>

<p>"Only," she went on with childish frankness, and giving him
one of her swift, dark glances, quickly withdrawn, "I am afraid
you are&mdash;are <i>angry</i> that I have come here!"</p>

<p>Oh, wondrous perceptions of innocence! He flushed a little under
his handsome brown skin, and pulled nervously at his silky mustache.</p>

<p>"Why should you think so?" he queried.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I&mdash;I seemed to feel it in the air," she said,
vaguely, and in a little troubled tone. "You <i>are</i> vexed about it&mdash;<i>aren't</i>
you?" and she turned on him fully for the first time the full
gaze of those large wondrous black eyes, before whose searching
gaze even the most accomplished Ananias might have hesitated to
answer falsely.</p>

<p>"I should be discourteous if I answered in the affirmative," he
said.</p>

<p>"You needn't mind that&mdash;not the least bit in the world," she
said, eagerly. "You see, I didn't know when I came that <i>you</i> were
here. I thought there was only an old lady&mdash;your mamma. If you
don't want me here, I must go back to&mdash;&mdash; I can go away," she
said, growing strangely pale as the words left her lips.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would have been better pleased if I had not been
here," he said, curiously, as they walked on down a wide, graveled
path, leading to the river.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so&mdash;I don't like men very much," she answered, with
innocent frankness.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous affectation, when she is dead in love with a fortune-hunting
scoundrel!" thought he, gnawing his mustache vexedly.</p>

<p>Somehow since Beatrix Gordon had come to Eden he chose to take
the most contemptible view of her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like me to go away?" he said, with fine
sarcasm.</p>

<p>They had come to the pretty rustic fence that bordered the lawn.
Below it was the public road, beyond this the wide, beautiful river,
with the white sails coming and going on its glassy breast. Beatrix
sunk down on a convenient seat with a crimson, dismayed face.
Some of the flowers fell from her overskirt in the surprise with
which she regarded him.</p>

<p>"Oh, what have I said? I didn't mean <i>that</i>&mdash;never!" she cried,
as he stooped to restore her treasures. "I wouldn't have you go
away from your beautiful home for me, Mr. Le Roy."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will stay. I dare say Eden is wide enough for us
to keep out of each other's way," he answered, as he sat down by
her side.</p>

<p>"Yes, surely," she cried; "and if&mdash;if you will only tell me how,
I won't bother you&mdash;I won't come in your way at all."</p>

<p>"Very well," grimly. "We will both stay at Eden and compromise
that way. We will try not to intrude upon each other.
My favorite haunt is the library. If you will keep out of there, you
may have the right of way in the rest of the house without materially
disturbing me."</p>

<p>Palpable dismay lowered over the lifted face that looked so lovely
in the golden sunlight.</p>

<p>"The library? And the books are all there&mdash;aren't they?" she
asked, with a note of keen yearning in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes; do you like books?" he asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"I love them," she answered, discarding the word "like" as she
had done about the flowers. There was no half way strain in her
nature. Fervent, ardent, impetuous, the word was too cold for her.</p>

<p>Those things that pleased her she <i>loved</i>.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps I will lend you some books sometimes, if you
will only keep out of my sanctum," he said, coolly. "Do you
promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise," she replied, with a gentle, smothered sigh.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she lifted her eyes and asked him the last question
he would have expected to hear from a girl nurtured in the lap of
wealth and luxury.</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Roy, if you were a girl like I am&mdash;and if you hadn't
any parents, nor home, nor friends&mdash;nor any money&mdash;nor any practical
education&mdash;what would you do to earn an honest living?"</p>

<p>There was a palpable anxiety in voice and face. She had grown
very pale, her dark eyes were distinctly wistful.</p>

<p>"She is thinking of that obnoxious lover. She would even dare
poverty for his sake," he said to himself in displeasure.</p>

<p>Aloud he answered carelessly:</p>

<p>"It is hard to say what I should do in such a case, Miss Gordon.
I believe I should throw myself into that beautiful river yonder and
so end all."</p>

<p>In the dark after-days he remembered those words.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>Beatrix Gordon looked at the beautiful river with wide, dark
eyes. The summer sunshine gilded the blue waves, the white sails
dotted its wide expanse like fairy shallops gliding to and fro. It
was grand and dazzlingly beautiful, but the young girl shivered as
she thought of the dark depths below. She turned from it to look
gravely into St. Leon Le Roy's handsome face with its cold, cynical
eyes.</p>

<p>"You would throw yourself into the river and so end all," she
repeated. "Oh, Mr. Le Roy, is it so hard for a poor girl to live that
suicide is the least choice of evils?"</p>

<p>Her little hands clasped each other tightly over the mass of glowing
flowers in her lap, and her red lips trembled with earnestness.
He looked at her in something like wonder.</p>

<p>"I do not see why Mr. Gordon's daughter should trouble herself
over such a question," he said. "But since you ask me I must answer
yes. The world is full of pitfalls for the young and beautiful
girl who has her own living to gain. Were I in the situation you
describe, I believe I should speedily end the struggle with fate by a
leap into the river."</p>

<p>These hastily spoken words, too, he was fated to recall in an hour
of which he dreamed not now.</p>

<p>Beatrix did not answer him. She sat very still, looking before her
with a strange, far-away expression on her face. A long, deep, unconscious
sigh quivered over her lips.</p>

<p>"You are troubled over what I said&mdash;why?" he asked, curiously.</p>

<p>And the girl answered, with a shiver:</p>

<p>"I am afraid of life."</p>

<p>St. Leon began to feel vaguely interested in this girl whose coming
he had dreaded so much. She was not like other young ladies
he had known&mdash;not what he had expected the rich Mr. Gordon's
daughter to be. There was a spice of originality about her. Why
should she, the petted child of wealth and luxury, think about these
things of which she had talked? Was it because her lover was poor?</p>

<p>He did not like to think of that lover from whom her parents
wished to separate her. She was a child, he said to himself&mdash;too
young to burn her heart in the flame of love.</p>

<p>"I do not see why you should fear life. It is likely to prove very
fair and bright to you, if you do your duty&mdash;if you implicitly <i>obey</i>
the wishes of your parents," he said, watching her keenly.</p>

<p>The lovely face flushed crimson, but she made him no answer.
She played with her flowers nervously. She was afraid of St. Leon
Le Roy's keen, merciless eyes.</p>

<p>"You do not wish me to lecture you upon your duty?" he said,
after waiting in vain for her to reply.</p>

<p>"No, I do not think I do," she replied, frankly.</p>

<p>"Then I beg your pardon. Indeed, I am not worthy of lecturing
any one upon that cold, hard word, duty," he said to himself rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
than her. "I have not been a very dutiful son myself," a shadow
crossing his dark features.</p>

<p>Beatrix again had no answer ready.</p>

<p>She went on quietly grouping her flowers into a large bunch. He
watched the white hands with a lazy, æsthetic pleasure in their
beauty as they gleamed among the crimson flowers of which she had
gathered a larger quantity than of any other color.</p>

<p>He began to talk to her of the city where she lived, of the places
she had visited, of people whom he supposed the Gordons would
know. He was amazed at her ignorance on subjects where he
would have supposed her to be at home.</p>

<p>"I have been to very few places, and I know very few people,"
she said, blushing. "I&mdash;I haven't been introduced into society yet. I
am too young."</p>

<p>"Then where did she pick up that lover?" he asked himself.
"She must have become infatuated with her dancing-master or her
music-master."</p>

<p>But that evening when Mrs. Le Roy opened the piano and asked
her to play, Beatrix begged to be excused. Being pressed, she declared
that she had never learned the piano, she did not care for music&mdash;at
least not very much.</p>

<p>No one expressed the surprise they felt. St. Leon played an aria
for his mother, then they closed the piano.</p>

<p>"So it was not her music-master who won her heart. The circle
narrows down to the professor of the terpsichorean art," he said to
himself.</p>

<p>"My dear, I have been watching you closely," said Mrs. Le Roy,
suddenly. "You do not at all resemble your mother. She had blue
eyes, yours are black. Her features were quite different from yours.
I have seen your father, but I forget how he looked. I suppose you
are like him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am like my father," Beatrix answered, but her face crimsoned,
and she looked as if she were about to burst into tears. She
commanded herself with an effort, and a little later, declaring that
her head ached, she begged to be excused, and left the room.</p>

<p>"Poor girl! she is very unhappy!" said Mrs. Le Roy. "Isabel
Gordon was very careless to let that child have a lover! She has
no business out of the school-room."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>Beatrix went swiftly to the pretty dressing-room, where the
maid was, busy sewing on a dinner-dress of pink nuns' veiling for
her beautiful young mistress. She sunk down upon a chair and
looked at Clarice with somber, miserable eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clarice, I shall have to give it all up," she panted. "They
suspect me&mdash;I am quite sure they do!"</p>

<p>Clarice looked frightened and disturbed, and even reproachful.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Gordon, don't say that," she exclaimed. "After all
the drilling you've had, a clever, pretty girl like you ought to be
able to act your part. But it's just as I told you to-day. You're
too timid and nervous."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I am conscious of my guilt," answered the girl, sadly.
"I should not be timid and nervous in my own proper character,
Clarice. But you know 'conscience makes cowards of us all.' Besides,
I am ignorant on many subjects which Beatrix Gordon ought
to know well. The people and places they ask me about I know
nothing of, and they look surprised. To-day Mrs. Le Roy asked
me to play on the piano. When I said I did not know how, I wish
you could have seen their faces!"</p>

<p>"That was rather bad. The most of young ladies know how to
play on the piano," said Clarice. "But anyhow they couldn't
make out a case against you for that. You might have said that
you didn't care for music."</p>

<p>"So I did, but the lie almost blistered my lips," said the girl,
"for I love music dearly, and when Mr. Le Roy played a beautiful
aria I was afraid he would see my delight on my face."</p>

<p>"You must be careful over that. Stick to your text," warned
the maid. "If you make them think you don't like music they will
not think it strange you cannot play. Was there anything else unpleasant?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Mrs. Le Roy told me I did not at all resemble my mother.
Oh, I was so frightened when she began. My heart sprung to my
lips!"</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked Clarice, attentively.</p>

<p>"I told them I resembled my father&mdash;that was true at least," answered
Beatrix, sighing.</p>

<p>"Well, the game is not lost yet," said Clarice. "Courage, Miss
Gordon&mdash;hold your own bravely as you can. Remember all that is
lost if you fail."</p>

<p>"I try to remember it," sighed the girl. "If it were not for <i>her</i>,
Clarice, I should break down, I know I should. It is terrible to be
living a lie. Oh, Clarice, do you think she is very happy now?"</p>

<p>"Happy as a queen," said Clarice, enthusiastically: "and she
was so good and sweet she deserved it. Oh, you mustn't regret that
you made a little sacrifice for her! And is it a sacrifice, after all?
Look at this grand, beautiful home, all this luxury around you.
Where would you be if my mistress hadn't sent you here?"</p>

<p>Where, indeed? The false Beatrix Gordon shivered as if with
ague, her face blanched to a pallid hue. She thought of the homeless
outcasts in the horrible streets, of the dark, flowing river, of St.
Leon Le Roy's careless words to her that day: "I would throw myself
into the river, and so end all!"</p>

<p>"I should not do that unless I were driven to desperation," said
the girl to herself with unconscious bravery.</p>

<p>She looked through the window out upon the beautiful grounds.</p>

<p>"It is a lovely home," she said. "I could be very happy here if
I had no shadow on my heart. But I cannot forget my sin. I remember
always some lines that I have read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Some flowers of Eden we still inherit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the trail of the serpent is over them all.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I would not call it a sin if I were you," said Clarice. "That is
too harsh a name. My mistress did not call it so. She said it was
only a justifiable counter plot, only a harmless, girl's conspiracy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"She ought to know best. She is older and wiser than I am,"
said the girl, with a gleam of hope on her face.</p>

<p>Clarice was very clever for a girl in her situation. As she worked
away steadily on the pink dress, she artfully followed up the impression
her last words had made:</p>

<p>"For my part I think it is the best joke I ever heard of. I do
not pity the Gordons one bit. They deserve to be fooled!" she said.
"There was no fault in Miss Gordon's lover, only he was not as
rich as she was."</p>

<p>"Poverty is almost a crime in the eyes of the rich&mdash;is it not?"
asked her mistress thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," Clarice answered, almost tartly, and she began to hum
under her breath:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Dollars and dimes, dollars and dimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An empty pocket is the worst of crimes!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her young mistress remained gazing thoughtfully from the window,
the sad expression of her face hidden by the falling waves of
her golden hair. Deep, heavy sighs breathed at intervals over her
lips.</p>

<p>Several days passed quietly without anything occurring to frighten
our masquerading heroine again. The Le Roys gave no sign of their
surprise at anything that occurred. They had, in fact, concluded
that a great deal of her oddness and originality arose from the fact
of the lover in the case. When she looked sad, as she often did,
they concluded she was thinking of him. When St. Leon actually
came upon her weeping silently one day he thought it was on account
of the separation from our hero.</p>

<p>It vexed him. He did not go away and leave her alone, as his
mother would have done. He said to her, sarcastically:</p>

<p>"Are you crying for your mamma, little girl?"</p>

<p>Beatrix flashed him a swift, angry look through her tears, and answered:</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"At least she has the grace to be honest," he said to himself.</p>

<p>Some curiosity came over him regarding the man who had won
the heart of this girl. He would have liked to know his name, and
what he looked like, and if he was worthy of the prize he had won.</p>

<p>"Confide in me, Miss Gordon," he said, obeying an impulse he
could not himself understand. "Tell me what your trouble is.
Perhaps I can help you."</p>

<p>Beatrix shuddered in horror. Ah, if he knew, how little he would
be inclined to help her. Rather he would spurn her from the proud
gates of Eden.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she faltered. "I thank you, but it is
nothing."</p>

<p>He looked at her a little scornfully.</p>

<p>"I have heard that women cry for nothing," he said. "I suppose
it must be true, as I now hear it confirmed by one of the sex."</p>

<p>She seldom saw him except at meals, and a little while in the
drawing-room of an evening. The most of his time was spent in the
library or out riding and walking. But one day he came to her abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going up to New York for a few days," he said. "I hope
you will make use of my library while I am out of the way."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, radiantly.</p>

<p>"If I should see your parents," he continued, "shall I give them
any message for you?"</p>

<p>She started, and the crimson rose she was holding fell from her
hands. He wondered why she grew so deadly pale, and trembled
so. The sudden radiance of a moment ago had all gone from her
face.</p>

<p>"Give them my love," she said in a husky voice, "and tell them&mdash;tell
them that I am greatly enjoying my visit to Eden."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon came home one afternoon and made his way straight to
the library. The thickly carpeted floor gave back no echo to his
footfalls, and he stood on the threshold of the room several minutes
gazing in at the open door unobserved by the single occupant of the
apartment.</p>

<p>As he had shrewdly suspected, his mother's guest had availed herself
to the full of his permission to use the library in his absence.</p>

<p>Quite oblivious of his near presence now, Beatrix was curled up
in his great easy-chair in a cozy, kittenish attitude, her warm flushed
cheek buried in the hollow of one small hand, her dark eyes bent in
rapt interest on an open book in her lap. A ray of sunshine stealing
through the lace curtains at the window penciled golden bars
on her white dress and bright hair, making her look like a picture
to whose beauty St. Leon's cultured eyes were by no means oblivious.
He hesitated to startle her from her pretty negligent attitude,
but as he gazed his mesmeric eyes irresistibly attracted hers. She
glanced up and met his dark, burning eyes fixed with a strange inscrutable
expression upon her own.</p>

<p>Instantly Beatrix sprung up, the book falling to the floor, a little
cry of surprise on her lips, her face paling, a look of inexplicable
terror in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Am I an ogre that you do me the honor to be frightened at me,
Miss Gordon?" he inquired, advancing into the room, a tone of displeasure
in his deep, musical voice.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was not frightened&mdash;only startled, sir," said Beatrix, faintly,
as she stooped to recover her book.</p>

<p>She laid it upon the table and was about to leave the room when
he stopped her with a slight wave of his gloved hand.</p>

<p>"Resume your seat, Miss Gordon. I shall not believe you are not
frightened if you run away like this," he said.</p>

<p>She sat down with a gasp and waited. She had been full of vague
fears and suspicions regarding his visit to New York. She waited
with a beating heart and a pale face for his next words. He would
say, with that fine scorn his mobile face was so capable of expressing:</p>

<p>"You are found out in your miserable conspiracy, Laurel Vane.
You have come here pretending to be Mr. Gordon's daughter while
you covered her elopement with her lover. The true Beatrix Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
is far away, married to the man she has chosen, in defiance of her
parents and friends. Punishment cannot reach her, but you, Laurel
Vane, will have to suffer for the outrage you have helped to perpetrate
on the Gordons and on us."</p>

<p>While she waited with a sick horror to hear him utter those words,
she wondered vaguely what they would do to her for her share in
Beatrix Gordon's conspiracy. Could they cast her into prison? She
had seen the outside of a penitentiary once. How grim and dark
and forbidding it looked with its iron doors and grated windows?
Would they shut her up in all her youth and beauty in such a horrible
place as that, and for how long? She shuddered as she thought
that it might be for life. She had no idea, in her youth and innocence,
how far and how long the powerful arm of the law could
reach.</p>

<p>But the dreadful words for which she waited while a hand of ice
seemed to grip her throat, remained unspoken.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy seated himself leisurely and drew off his dark kid
gloves. Then he took up the volume she had been reading, and
glanced at the title.</p>

<p>"I hope you have enjoyed your monopoly of my library," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, faintly.</p>

<p>"And you are sorry I have returned to oust you from its enjoyments&mdash;aren't
you?" he asked, studying her young face keenly.</p>

<p>"I should be very rude to say so," she answered, gaining courage
as the dreadful charge for which she waited was delayed.</p>

<p>"As to that you cannot be ruder than I was in desiring you to
stay out of this room while I was at home," he replied, with an air
of insincerity. "Will you pardon my selfishness, Miss Gordon, and
permit me to remove the embargo?"</p>

<p>She could scarcely believe her ears. His tone was distinctly kind.
Had he, then, found out nothing? Was her secret safe yet a little
longer?</p>

<p>Seeing that she hesitated, and did not speak, he continued:</p>

<p>"I give you <i>carte blanche</i> as to the use of this room whether I am
absent or present. Will you come here whenever you choose, to
read, or write, or study? You will not disturb me, neither shall I
disturb you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she murmured, not yet daring to look at him.</p>

<p>"You thank me, but you do not say you will come," he said.
"Will you please to look at me a moment, Miss Gordon? I like to
be looked at when I am talking."</p>

<p>With an effort she lifted her long fringed lashes, and forced herself
to meet his proud, glittering dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I am a spoiled child. I like to be humored," he said, with a
smile that lighted his face into a subtle sweetness that first showed
her how dangerously fascinating the master of Eden could be when
he willed. "I want you to tell me, Miss Gordon, that you forgive
my selfishness the other day, and that you will come to this room as
freely as to any other room in the house. You will promise me,
will you not? No one ever refuses <i>me</i> anything!"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive&mdash;you had a right"&mdash;she said, incoherently.
"If there was&mdash;and mind, I do not admit there was&mdash;I
forgive you freely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you. And you will come?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;perhaps," she stammered.</p>

<p>He pulled at his dark mustache impatiently.</p>

<p>"I must have a more definite promise than that," he said. "I
am used to having my way about everything."</p>

<p>Though the words were arrogant, the tone was kind. He was
thoroughly in earnest. She hesitated. She did not want to be
drawn into such a promise, standing too much in awe of the stately
master of Eden.</p>

<p>"You will not promise," he said, piqued. "Very well. But
you are the first woman who ever refused a request of St. Leon Le
Roy's. Your forgiveness was only half hearted."</p>

<p>He was more vexed than she knew. His wonderful condescension
had not borne the fruit he expected. He leaned back in his
chair with his elbow on the table, and pulled at his dark mustache
with his shapely fingers, the costly diamond on his hand flashing
luridly.</p>

<p>"What a stubborn little mite it is to refuse to humor me," he
thought to himself in displeasure.</p>

<p>While the small object of his displeasure watched the door with
longing eyes, yearning to escape from the oppressive dignity of his
presence, she felt herself growing crimson under his cold, proud
gaze.</p>

<p>"You have not asked me yet if I saw your parents," he said, after
some minutes of that oppressive silence.</p>

<p>"It is coming now," thought the small culprit in despair, and she
felt guiltily that the color was all fading out of her cheeks under
those watchful eyes. She could only stammer, faintly, "Did you?"</p>

<p>To her infinite joy and relief, he answered in the negative.</p>

<p>"No, I did not see them. I called twice, but at both times they
were out&mdash;once driving in the park, and again attending a reception."</p>

<p>"You do not look sorry, Miss Gordon, although it was purely out
of courtesy to you that I went there."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am very sorry," she murmured, but she could not
make her face look so.</p>

<p>His words were so great a relief to her that she could not look disappointed.
He did not tell her how disappointed he was. He would
not have owned to himself that he had hoped to hear something
about that lover from whom they had separated her. He would
even have liked to have seen him. It was a new thing for the <i>blasé</i>,
world-weary St. Leon Le Roy to feel curious over anything; but he
had a great deal of curiosity over the man whom Beatrix Gordon
loved.</p>

<p>"I should like to know if he is worthy of her," was his excuse to
his own heart.</p>

<p>But he had not seen the Gordons, and he had found out nothing
about their daughter's lover.</p>

<p>"If he is good and true and noble I should like to help the child
to happiness," he said to himself. "If he is an ignoble fortune-hunter,
as they say, I should most decidedly try to forward the
Gordons' plot."</p>

<p>And it was rather curious that in his own mind he had quite decided
that the unknown young man was a villain of the deepest dye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
He pitied Beatrix for having fallen in love with a scamp who was
only after her money. But as the days went by a change came over
Beatrix that puzzled him.</p>

<p>Some of her shyness, her timidity, her sadness wore off. A look
of contentment dawned on the fair face and in the dark eyes. Her
cheeks gained color and roundness. She even laughed sometimes, a
mellow laugh that was so sweet and glad it thrilled one's heart to
hear it. Mrs. Le Roy was puzzled.</p>

<p>"She is certainly not pining for her lover," she said to her son.
"At first she was so strange and sad I thought she was breaking
her heart over him. But she is so young it is likely that change of
scene has driven him completely out of her mind. The Gordons did
well to send her here."</p>

<p>The day came when she changed her mind on that latter point.</p>

<p>In her heart Mrs. Le Roy had a secret fancy that the charms of
her son had quite blotted out the image of Beatrix's absent lover from
her young heart. Not that St. Leon or Beatrix gave her any reason
to think so, but the wish was father to the thought. She would have
been delighted if these two had fallen in love with each other, for
the greatest desire of her heart was to see St. Leon married.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>In the private parlor of a neat hotel in a city not very far from
New York, the true Beatrix Gordon was sitting one lovely morning
awaiting the coming of her husband.</p>

<p>Although Beatrix had deceived and deserted her parents, and
foisted an impostor on the aristocratic Le Roys, she looked positively
and undeniably happy this bright summer morning. Her lovely
blonde face, with its crown of soft golden hair, glowed with love and
happiness, and her beauty was enhanced by her becoming morning-dress
of soft pale blue with delicate trimmings of rich cream
tinted lace.</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly, and Cyril Wentworth, her handsome
young husband, entered with a letter in his hand. He kissed his
fair young bride, and held the delicate envelope tantalizingly out of
reach.</p>

<p>"At last!" cried young Mrs. Wentworth eagerly, and she sprung
upon a chair and gayly possessed herself of her letter. "It is from
my sweet little Laurel."</p>

<p>She tore it open and ran her eyes quickly over the contents, while
her husband watched her expressive face with deep anxiety.</p>

<p>She finished at last, and turned her fond, smiling blue eyes upon
Cyril's questioning face.</p>

<p>"All goes well," she said. "They have not discovered my
charming little plot yet. Papa and mamma have written, and they
are both as well as usual. Clarice answered their letters, and imitated
my hand and style so well that they were completely imposed
upon."</p>

<p>"Clarice must be a clever maid," said Cyril.</p>

<p>"She is," said Beatrix. "Her education is far above that of her
class generally. She was very valuable to me. I hated to part with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
her, but I was obliged to send her to Eden to keep up appearances,
answer mamma's letters, and keep Laurel Vane up to her part."</p>

<p>"And when is this farce to end?" asked Cyril.</p>

<p>"Oh, not for several months yet, if I can help it," answered the
pretty bride, looking frightened at the very idea.</p>

<p>"But why keep it up so long? I cannot understand your reluctance
to have your parents learn the truth, love. They cannot forbid
the bans now, for we are united as fast as Church and State can
bind us," said Cyril Wentworth, who had an honest, open nature;
and now that he had won his bonny bride, longed to have the whole
world hear what a prize he had won.</p>

<p>"I have a secret reason, Cyril, darling," said the fair bride, twining
her arms about his neck, and looking up in his face with sweet,
shining eyes. "If Laurel plays her part well and I can keep our
marriage a secret a few months, some great good fortune will come
to us, Cyril. If not&mdash;if it is all found out sooner&mdash;why, then," with
a little contented sigh, "I shall still have you, my dear. Fate cannot
take you from me!"</p>

<p>"I am dying of curiosity, darling," laughed Cyril Wentworth.</p>

<p>"No matter. You shall not hear one word till the time is up,"
answered Beatrix, gayly. "I forbid you to even think of the matter
again, sir!"</p>

<p>"Your wishes are my law," answered the lover-husband, in a
tone as gay as hers.</p>

<p>"There is one thing that troubles me," she said, presently, running
her eyes again over the letter which she still held open in her
hand. "Laurel writes me that Mrs. Le Roy's son has returned from
his European tour, and is at Eden."</p>

<p>"Why should that trouble you, dearest?" he inquired, tenderly.</p>

<p>"Do you not see that the chances of discovery are doubled, Cyril?
Mrs. Le Roy seldom leaves home, and would be far more likely to
be imposed upon by our little conspiracy than would her keen-witted
son. Laurel writes me that he is keen, critical, brusque. She is
afraid of him."</p>

<p>"I have a fancy about this Mr. Le Roy," said Cyril, lightly.
"He will fall in love with the pretty little impostor and marry her."</p>

<p>Beatrix looked grave and troubled at this novel suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> would never do," she cried. "My little Laurel is as
beautiful as a dream, but she is not a fitting mate for St. Leon Le
Roy. He is wealthy and aristocratic, and, I have heard, as proud
as Lucifer. And she&mdash;a drunken journalist's daughter! No, no,
that would never do, Cyril. She would not dare! I am not afraid
of such a thing. She shall come and live with me and be like my
own sister when her stay at Eden is over, and we shall find her a
husband more suitable to her than St. Leon Le Roy!"</p>

<p>Two months had passed, and Laurel Vane still remained at Eden,
in her character of Mr. Gordon's daughter. The clever conspiracy
had not been discovered yet.</p>

<p>Indeed there seemed less chance of this catastrophe than at first.
Laurel, with ready adaptability, was beginning to fit herself into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
place. Under Clarice's constant tuitions and admonitions, her shyness
and timidity had been somewhat overcome, and a pretty, graceful
ease had replaced it. Her beauty had expanded and increased
like a flower in the sunshine. As the first restraint of her manner
wore off, she developed a rare grace and winning sweetness that,
added to her native originality, made her very charming. Mrs. Le
Roy, in her stately, quiet way, had grown fond of her guest.</p>

<p>"Although there could not be a greater contrast imagined than
exists between Beatrix and her mother, I am inclined to give the
palm to the former," she confided to St. Leon. "I was fond of
Mrs. Gordon when she was a girl. She was a fair, sweet young girl,
but she lacked the charms that distinguish Beatrix. The girl makes
me think of some beautiful, timid, wild bird."</p>

<p>"At first you thought her awkward and uncultivated," said St.
Leon, carelessly.</p>

<p>"It was mere shyness that has worn off long ago," answered Mrs.
Le Roy. "She puzzles me still, but she no longer appears awkward
and uncultured. Still I admit that her education has been an unconventional
one. She knows little that a girl in her position might
be expected to know. On the contrary, she has some attainments
not to be looked for. She knows German and Latin and some
French, but she has no accomplishments, and she cannot play the
piano. She says her father educated her. I take it he is a peculiar
person."</p>

<p>"Rather, I should say," St. Leon assents, with his slightly bored
air.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I believe she is perfectly cured of her fancy for that&mdash;that
person. I have never heard his name yet&mdash;have you, St.
Leon?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is Cyril Wentworth."</p>

<p>"A good name. Is it possible that Beatrix told you?" exclaims
his mother.</p>

<p>"No; I heard it once, by the merest accident, on one of my trips
to New York," St. Leon answers, with bland indifference.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;a&mdash;ah!&mdash;what kind of a man is he, St. Leon? As black
as he was painted?"</p>

<p>"By no means&mdash;they say even the devil is not that, you know,"
with a short, dry laugh. "I have even seen the fellow. He is comparatively
poor&mdash;I should say that that is the worst there is to him."</p>

<p>"Handsome?"</p>

<p>"As Apollo&mdash;and better still&mdash;<i>young</i>," he answers, with a short,
dry laugh that has a ring of bitterness in it.</p>

<p>The mother's heart, quick in instinct, catches the subtle intonation
of almost envy in that one concluding word.</p>

<p>She lays her white hand on his shoulder and looks up into the
handsome, proud, world-weary face with its cold, curled lips&mdash;not
pityingly&mdash;St. Leon has never borne pity in his life&mdash;but with fondest
love and admiration.</p>

<p>"As young as you, St. Leon?" she asks, speciously solving his
unacknowledged wound.</p>

<p>"Why, mother, how you talk!" he says, not unkindly. "Why, I
am <i>old</i>. Thirty five my last birthday, and the crow's-feet, and gray
hairs not so far away!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you care, my son?" she asks him, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"Care&mdash;why should I?" he asks, frowning. "And yet I have
no mind to contradict the poet, who says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The loss of youth is sadness<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To all who think or feel&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A wound no after gladness<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Can ever wholly heal;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet so many share it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We learn at last to bear it.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His glance wanders from the window out into the beautiful
grounds, where Laurel Vane is wandering, bright-eyed, bright-haired,
lovely, in the golden springtime of youth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet face, swift eyes, and gleaming<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Sun-gifted mingling hair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lips like two rose-buds dreaming<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In June's fruit-scented air.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Life, when her spring days meet her,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Hope, when her angels greet her,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is not more calm&mdash;nor sweeter,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And love is not more fair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"After all, there is nothing on earth so beautiful as youth," he
says, aloud, his dark eyes following the flutter of that white robe
among the trees.</p>

<p>She looks furtively past him and sees Laurel, too, the sunlight
shining on the fair young face, her white apron-overskirt heaped
high with flowers after her usual fashion, the refrain of a song on
her lips that floats back to them in snatches. It is Mrs. Browning's&mdash;"The
Lady's Yes."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, I answered you last night,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">No, this morning, sir, I say&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy laid her delicate hand, all glittering with jewels, on
the shoulder of her idolized son.</p>

<p>"St. Leon, you talk of growing old," she said. "My son, does
not the flight of time remind you that you are neglecting a duty
you owe to yourself?"</p>

<p>He turned to look curiously into her face, and the white figure
out among the trees wandered further away, seeking new delights,
like the bright-winged butterflies, among the flowers. The echo of
her song died in the distance.</p>

<p>"Duty, mother," he said, carelessly. "I did not know that the
vocabulary of my life contained that hard word. I thought all I
had to do was to 'eat, drink, and'"&mdash;sarcastically&mdash;"'be merry.'"</p>

<p>"St. Leon, you are but feigning ignorance of my meaning," she
said, wistfully. "You understand me."</p>

<p>"Upon my honor, no," he said. "Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"You should marry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>A dark-red flush crept under his olive skin. His slender, straight
black brows met in a frown over the proud dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought we had dropped that subject ages ago," he said,
frigidly.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," pleadingly. "I cannot help but revive it again.
St. Leon, when you quoted that epicurean motto, 'eat, drink, and
be merry,' you forgot that latter clause, 'for to-morrow we <i>die</i>.'"</p>

<p>He shrugged his broad shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"'For to-morrow we <i>die</i>,'" she repeated. "And oh, St. Leon,
there is no heir to Eden!"</p>

<p>"<i>Quelle importe?</i>" lifting his dark brows with a slight gesture of
indifference.</p>

<p>"Oh, my son, do not treat it with indifference," she cried. "You
are the last Le Roy of your race. The fine old name will die with
you, the wealth of the Le Roys will pass to strangers, unless you
marry and leave an heir. I am proud. I cannot bear to have it
thus. Oh, St. Leon, choose yourself a wife and me a daughter from
among the fair dames of your own land."</p>

<p>Her handsome, haughty old face was transformed with emotion,
her dark eyes dim with tears. He turned from the sight of it and
looked from the window again, but the slim white figure no longer
gleamed among the green trees and the bright <i>parterres</i> of flowers.
It had strayed out of sight.</p>

<p>"Where shall I find you a daughter worthy of your love, my lady
mother?" he said, lightly, yet with some intangible emotion beneath
his tone.</p>

<p>She hesitated, and her glance, too, wandered from the window
and came back disappointed.</p>

<p>"St. Leon, what do you think of Beatrix Gordon?" she asked,
wistfully.</p>

<p>The dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"For shame, mother! Would I steal another man's betrothed?"
he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, Laurel Vane had strayed carelessly on to the gates of
Eden, the light song still lingering on her lips, the light of the day
reflected in her eyes and on her face. She was learning to be happy,
this beautiful girl over whose unconscious head hung the shadow of
long years of sorrow.</p>

<p>She leaned her arm on the rustic gate and looked wonderingly, as
she often did, across the dusty carriage-road at the beautiful river.</p>

<p>"Should I ever be coward enough to throw myself into its dark
depths, and 'so end all'?" she asked herself, with sudden gravity.</p>

<p>A sudden step, the dark figure of a man looming before her, made
her lift her wide, dark eyes. A cry of mingled horror, loathing,
and fear burst from her lips.</p>

<p>"Ross Powell!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>If Laurel Vane was thunderstruck at the unexpected sight of the
villain who had so deeply insulted her helpless innocence in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
York, Ross Powell on the other hand was delighted. His bold eyes
gleamed with evil joy, his thin lips curled in a mocking smile.</p>

<p>"Miss Vane," he exclaimed, "is it possible that I find you again
after all my fruitless search? But I might have known that such
an angel would fly to Eden!"</p>

<p>Horror unutterable had seized upon Laurel. The song had died
on her lips, the color fled from her face, she stared at her foe with
parted lips, from which the breath came in palpitating gasps, while
her wide, terrified eyes had the anguished look of some hunted
creature.</p>

<p>He had come to betray her, she said to herself. All was ended
now. He had found her out. He would tell the Le Roys who she
was, and how she had deceived them. She could fancy Mrs. Le
Roy's scathing words of condemnation. She could imagine the
lightning scorn in St. Leon's proud, cold eyes.</p>

<p>Stifling the moan upon her lips, she cried out in passionate despair:</p>

<p>"Ross Powell, what has brought you here?"</p>

<p>"I might ask you the same question," he returned, coolly. "It
certainly never entered my mind that I should find the daughter of
Louis Vane a visitor at Eden."</p>

<p>He had spoken unwarily. His words let in a sudden light upon
her mind.</p>

<p>He had not traced her here then. Whatever had brought him to
Eden it had been some other cause than the denunciation of Beatrix
Gordon's plot.</p>

<p>Her heart leaped with hope, then sunk heavily again. He was
here, and he would find her out. She could trust to his hate and
his desire for vengeance for that.</p>

<p>Obeying a sudden, desperate impulse, she pushed open the gate
and stepped out into the road.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, bitterly. "Do you think that the
proud, rich Le Roys would have Laurel Vane for their guest? My
errand at Eden is done, Mr. Powell. Let me pass, if you please."</p>

<p>He stood before her, dumbfounded at her coolness, glancing from
her pale, agitated face to the flowers she carried in her apron with
ostentatious care.</p>

<p>"Your errand," he stammered. "The flowers?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, calmly. "I must take them home. Will
you please to stand out of the way, Mr. Powell?"</p>

<p>"One moment," he said, still hindering her way. "Where is
your home? Where can I find you?"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed scornfully upon him.</p>

<p>"What can it matter to you?" she said. "Do you think I would
receive you in my home? You, the cowardly insulter of helpless
girlhood? Never! I hate you as I hate the slimy, crawling serpent!
You have nothing to do with me. Out of my way!"</p>

<p>He caught her fiercely by the arm and hissed:</p>

<p>"I shall find you out! Be sure of that, my incarnation of indignant
virtue! And when I do, Laurel Vane, you shall find that the
serpent you hate can sting!"</p>

<p>She tried to shake off the brutal grasp of his fingers, but he held
her in a grasp of steel and would not let her go.</p>

<p>"You hurt me," she said, desperately. "Release my arm, Ross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Powell, or I will scream for help. I hear carriage-wheels coming.
Whoever it is I will appeal for protection."</p>

<p>The threat had the hoped-for effect. He threw her arm from him
with a smothered oath. Laurel pushed quickly past him and
walked on down the road. A carriage rattled past, and under
cover of the cloud of dust it raised she looked furtively back at her
worsted foe. He had entered the gate of Eden and was walking
slowly up the graveled path to the house.</p>

<p>"He is really going there," she said, trembling, "and, O Heaven,
upon what mission? He is Mr. Gordon's clerk, and he has come
upon some errand to Beatrix Gordon. They will send out to search
for me, and he will learn the truth. I cannot go back. I am
afraid! I must hide myself until he is gone!"</p>

<p>Her trembling limbs would scarcely support her, but she walked
on as fast as she could, her mind filled with vague conjectures and
dire suspicions.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Gordon has sent for Beatrix to return home," she
thought, despairingly. "Then the conspiracy will all be discovered.
I shall be driven away from beautiful Eden."</p>

<p>A pang like a dagger's thrust pierced her heart at the thought.
She looked back at the towered and turreted mansion, and the
beautiful extensive grounds, with something of that hopeless despair
our first mother must have felt on leaving Paradise.</p>

<p>The scent of the flowers she carried filled her with keenest pain.</p>

<p>"Shall I ever dare go back?" she said. "Am I going away for
the last time now, with no home, no friends to turn to in my despair&mdash;with
nothing but these flowers, and&mdash;a memory?"</p>

<p>As she plodded slowly along she came to a little private gate in
the rustic fence that inclosed Eden. It led into a picturesque, bosky
dell, with running streams, leafy shades, cool, green turf, and beds
of wild flowers and exquisite ferns. The master of Eden carried
the key to this private entrance, often preferring it to the more
ostentatious front gate, with its imposing lions keeping grim watch
and ward.</p>

<p>Laurel paused and leaned her arms on the low fence, and gazed
at the cool light and shade that flickered on the green grass beneath
the waving boughs of the trees. The hot, dusty road was disagreeable.
She longed to go inside and throw herself down to rest. No
one from the house ever came here except St. Leon Le Roy, and he but
seldom. It was a favorite haunt of Laurel's, and it struck her now
that it would be an excellent hiding-place.</p>

<p>Sighing at its inaccessibility Laurel bowed her head on her hands,
and the first thing that caught the sight of her downcast eyes was
the glitter of the steel key on the inside of the gate, where Mr. Le
Roy had inadvertently left it that morning.</p>

<p>With a cry of joy Laurel slipped her hand through the iron bars
of the gate, unlocked it, and entered.</p>

<p>Then she hastened to the remotest retreat on the grounds, a little
natural bower, formed by the thick interlacing boughs of the trees
and vines that grew thickly and luxuriantly close by a clear meandering
stream, rippling on with a pleasant murmur. Laurel threw
herself down at the foot of a tree in this sylvan retreat, and leaning
her head on her hand, listened pensively to the song of the birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and the musical murmur of the little streamlet. Her heart beat
more calmly in the solitude and stillness that was only broken by
the sweet sounds of nature. A little hope flickered feebly to life in
her breast.</p>

<p>"Clarice is so clever she will save me, perhaps," she whispered
to herself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>In the meantime Ross Powell with his mind full of his rencounter
with Laurel, and his passions all aflame with love and hate
commingled, wended his way to the stately home of the Le Roys.</p>

<p>It was true as Laurel had conjectured that he had come on business
with Beatrix Gordon, but the sudden, exciting meeting with
the dead author's daughter had almost driven his employer's business
out of his mind. He determined to get through this interview
with Miss Gordon as soon as possible, that he might gain time to
trace the scornful Laurel to her home.</p>

<p>His disappointment was accordingly great when he was informed
that Miss Gordon had gone for a walk. On his polite intimation
that he had but an hour to remain Clarice was sent out to bring her
mistress in.</p>

<p>Pretty, clever Clarice, having informed herself as to the identity
of the visitor, departed on her errand, her quick brain teeming with
plans to avoid the threatened exposure.</p>

<p>And Ross Powell waited his little hour, and saw the sunset gleams
kindling the waves of the Hudson with gold, and still she came
not. Impatience burned to fever-heat in his breast, though he was
outwardly calm and deferentially polite to Mrs. Le Roy and her
stately son.</p>

<p>The master of Eden inspired him with some little awe. He
shrunk from the keen, clear glances of the cynical dark eyes. They
seemed to pierce through him and read his shallow, selfish nature to
the core. He felt his own littleness by contrast with the calm,
proud bearing of St. Leon Le Roy, and resented it with carefully concealed
anger.</p>

<p>While he waited for Miss Gordon's coming, he ventured nonchalantly
on one leading question.</p>

<p>Could they tell him if there was a young lady staying in the
neighborhood named Laurel Vane?</p>

<p>"Laurel Vane&mdash;what a sweet, pretty name," said Mrs. Le Roy.
"No, I do not believe there is. I have never heard the name before."</p>

<p>"It is possible that she may be occupying some subordinate position&mdash;a
governess, perhaps," suggested Mr. Powell.</p>

<p>"I do not know, I have never heard of her," said the hostess,
carelessly; then, appealing to her son, "Have you, St. Leon?"</p>

<p>And he, in his blindness, answered:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Ross Powell did not know how to believe them. Had he not met
her coming out of their grounds, loaded with their rare flowers?
He asked himself what interest these rich people had in deceiving
him about Laurel Vane. While he puzzled over the question a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sudden solution presented itself to his mind. She must be figuring
under an assumed name. These rich Le Roys could have had no
interest in deceiving him about humble little Laurel Vane.</p>

<p>He did not know how nearly his chance conjecture had hit the
mark.</p>

<p>But his suspicions made him all the more eager to get away and
seek for her. If she had really been clever enough to hide herself under
a fictitious name, she would be all the harder to find. The difficulty
only made him more zealous in pursuit.</p>

<p>He assumed an air of polite regret, and began to pave his way to
departure.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot await Miss Gordon's return any longer
this evening, as I have a friend waiting for me at the hotel," he
said. "But indeed there is no real necessity that I should see her
at all beyond the pleasure her father would experience in hearing
that I had done so. I will call again in the morning, and perhaps
find her at home. In the meantime," he drew two letters and a
small package from his breast, "I am the bearer of a letter to you,
Mrs. Le Roy, and one for Miss Gordon, with this packet and her
father's love. I shall be pleased to receive your answer in the
morning before I return to New York."</p>

<p>He presented them and bowed himself out, so eager to find Laurel
Vane that he gave scarcely a thought to Miss Gordon's defection.</p>

<p>The deepening twilight fell, and still neither Clarice nor her mistress
returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy began to feel some little anxiety.</p>

<p>"She never stayed out like this before," she said to St. Leon.
"Can she have eluded us, and eloped with her lover? I am afraid
I have allowed her too much liberty. What do you think, St.
Leon?"</p>

<p>There was a gloomy flash in his eyes, but before he could speak
Clarice came running in, breathless and eager, with genuine alarm
on her face.</p>

<p>"Has he gone?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"An hour ago," said Mrs. Le Roy. "Where is Miss Gordon,
Clarice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Le Roy, I cannot find her anywhere," gasped the
girl, in a frightened tone.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>There was genuine alarm on the maid's pretty, intelligent face.
Mrs. Le Roy was startled.</p>

<p>"Have you been all over the grounds? Are you sure you have
looked everywhere?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, I do not think I have missed a single spot," cried
Clarice, wringing her hands. "I have been all over Eden. I have
been out into the road, and along the river bank. I am afraid she
has thrown herself into the water!"</p>

<p>St. Leon looked at her with his piercing dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Why should she do that?" he asked her, sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, surely you know she was very unhappy," she faltered.</p>

<p>"About her lover?" asked Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es, madam," faltered the maid, weakly.</p>

<p>St. Leon had crossed to the door. He came back and laid his
strong protecting hand gently on his mother's shoulder, and looked
down into her troubled face.</p>

<p>"Mother, do not be frightened," he said. "I will find Beatrix
for you. Ring for lights, and let Clarice stay here with you. I will
search for the child."</p>

<p>The words kindled a gleam of hope in her breast. She did not
see how deathly white his own face had grown.</p>

<p>He left her, and went out into the grounds on his self-appointed
mission of finding the missing girl. A new moon had risen, piercing
the twilight darkness with shafts of mellow light. In its mystic
rays the white graveled walks and groups of marble statuary glimmered
ghostly pale and wan. Clarice's apprehensive words rang in
his ears:</p>

<p>"I am afraid she has thrown herself into the water."</p>

<p>"Not that&mdash;oh, not that," he said to himself.</p>

<p>He left the more open grounds and went out into the thick shrubberies.
The dew was falling heavily, and the fragrance of flowers
was borne on the air. The almost oppressive sweetness of the tube-rose,
then at the height of its blooming, stole gently on his senses,
but ever afterward it was connected in his mind with a sense of loss
and pain.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, Beatrix!" he called ever and anon, in his eager search,
but no sweet voice replied, no slender, white-clad form bounded out
from among the dark green trees. He felt a strange sense of dreariness
in his search for Cyril Wentworth's missing love.</p>

<p>"She was very unhappy&mdash;I had begun to forget that," he said to
himself. "She had changed so much I thought she was beginning
to forget that episode with Cyril Wentworth. Was her apparent indifference
only a clever mask? Has she fled with him?"</p>

<p>He crushed something like a bitter execration between his lips at
the thought, and went on crashing madly through the shrubbery,
and so came out into the quiet dell where Beatrix had hidden that
evening in her frantic dread of Ross Powell.</p>

<p>He followed the course of the little singing stream that tried to
tell him in its musical murmur, "She is here, she is here," but he
was deaf to Nature's voice. His heart's cry drowned it.</p>

<p>"Why am I seeking her here?" he muttered, bitterly. "My
mother was right. She has had too much liberty. Cyril Wentworth
has stolen her away."</p>

<p>Nay, a sudden lance-like gleam of the silvery moonlight broke
through the interlacing boughs of the trees and touched with a pencil
of light a little white heap of something huddled under the bowering
trees. He went nearer, knelt down, and a cry of joy broke
from his stern, mustached lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>She had not thrown herself into the river, she had not fled with
her lover. He had wronged her in his thoughts. She was here.
Like a weary child she had flung herself down with her pale cheek
pillowed on one round, white arm, and was sleeping deeply, exhaustedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with the flowers all fallen from her apron and strewed in
odorous confusion about her.</p>

<p>He bent his dark head low over the golden one&mdash;perhaps to listen
if she slept&mdash;some murmured words fell from his lips. They
sounded like "My darling," but it must have been the wind sighing
in the leaves above them, or, perchance, the musical ripple of
the little streamlet. St. Leon Le Roy was too proud and cold for
such a weakness.</p>

<p>But he did not awake her at once. He bent over her softly, and
the shapely hand with its costly diamond flashing in the moonlight,
moved gently over the waving ripples of golden hair in mute caress
as though she had been a child.</p>

<p>How still and pale she lay. The white radiance of the moonlight
made her look so cold and white it thrilled him with a strange
terror.</p>

<p>"What if it were death?" he muttered, darkly, with a shiver.
"Death? Well," with a sudden, baleful fierceness, "what then?
Better death than surrender her to Cyril Wentworth!"</p>

<p>And a red-hot flame of jealousy tore his heart asunder like the
keen blade of a dagger.</p>

<p>He gazed for a moment in almost sullen satisfaction on the white,
sleeping face, then suddenly his mood changed. Something like
fear and dread came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Am I mad?" he asked himself, with a bitter self-reproach in
his voice, and he shook her gently, while almost unconsciously he
called her name aloud:</p>

<p>"Beatrix&mdash;darling!"</p>

<p>With a start she opened her eyes. She saw him bending over her
with an inscrutable expression upon his face. It was frowning,
fierce, almost bitterly angry. Yet all the summer night around her,
her languid pulses, and her beating heart, seemed to thrill and echo
to one sweet, fierce whisper. "Darling!" Had she dreamed it?
Was it but the figment of her slumbering brain?</p>

<p>As she struggled up she put out her hands to shut out the sight
of his face that seemed to frown darkly upon her. A cry broke
from her lips, full of fear and deprecation.</p>

<p>"Do not be angry. Do not scold me!" she wailed. "I am very
sorry&mdash;I&mdash;I will go away!"</p>

<p>"She is not half awake&mdash;she is dreaming," he said to himself,
and he touched her again, gently. "Wake up, Miss Gordon," he
said; "you are dreaming. I am not going to scold you, although
you have given us all a terrible scare falling asleep in the grounds
at this hour of the evening."</p>

<p>The somber, black eyes stared at him affrightedly. She did not
comprehend him yet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Le Roy, has he told you all?" she cried, clasping her
small hands tightly in the agony of her excitement. "Do you hate
me, despise me? Must I go away, all alone," with a shudder, "into
the dark, dark night?"</p>

<p>"Still dreaming," said St. Leon Le Roy to himself, and with a
sudden impulse of pity he bent down, put his arms about the small
white figure, and lifted her up to her feet. Then holding her gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in the clasp of one arm, he said, like one soothing a frightened
child:</p>

<p>"You have been asleep, Miss Gordon, and your dreams were
wild. Rouse yourself now, and come into the house with me. My
mother is greatly frightened at your absence!"</p>

<p>"Frightened," she repeated, a little vaguely, and nestling unconsciously
nearer to the warm, strong arm that held her.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have been missing several hours, and we have all had
a great fright about you. Clarice searched for you several hours,
but I had the happiness of finding you," he said, gently.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;nothing has happened? You are not angry?" she asked,
the mists beginning to clear from her brain.</p>

<p>"Nothing has happened, except that a gentleman came to see
you and went away disappointed. I am not angry, yet I ought to
be, seeing what a fright you gave me. Only think of me, Miss Gordon,
rushing about the garden with my mind full of 'dire imaginings,'
and finding you asleep on the grass like a tired baby. What
a descent from the sublime to the ridiculous!"</p>

<p>She began to comprehend all and drew herself, with a blush,
from the arm that still held her gently.</p>

<p>"Pardon me. You were half asleep and I held you to keep you
from falling," he said, with cool dignity. "Shall we return to the
house now? My mother is in great suspense."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she began, penitently, as she moved on
quietly by his side. "I did not mean to frighten any one. You&mdash;you
were very kind to come and look for me."</p>

<p>In her heart she was secretly singing pæans of gladness. She
was not discovered yet. Her clever move that evening had thrown
her enemy off his guard. Trying to keep the tremor out of her
voice, she asked with apparent carelessness:</p>

<p>"Who was my visitor, Mr. Le Roy?"</p>

<p>"Whom do you imagine?" he responded.</p>

<p>"Was&mdash;was it Mr. Wentworth?" she inquired, with artless innocence
and something in her voice that he interpreted as hope and
longing.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that Mr. Wentworth would be admitted inside
the doors of Eden?" he inquired, with grim anger.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said she, timidly.</p>

<p>"You must know that we have our instructions from your mother,"
he answered, stiffly.</p>

<p>Laurel decided that it would be in keeping with her character of
Beatrix Gordon to argue the point a little with Mr. Le Roy.</p>

<p>"Do you not think that mamma is a little harsh, Mr. Le Roy?"
she ventured, timidly. "Mr. Wentworth is good and noble and
handsome. His only fault is that he is poor."</p>

<p>"Therefore, he is no mate for you," St. Leon answered, almost
savagely.</p>

<p>"But why?" she persisted, longing to hear his opinion on the
subject.</p>

<p>"You are almost too young to understand these questions, Miss
Gordon, but it ought to be perfectly obvious to you that the wealthy
well-born daughter of Mr. Gordon should not descend to a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
clerk without connections, without money, and without prospects,"
he answered, almost brusquely.</p>

<p>"Must one take no account of love?" she asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"Unequal marriages seldom result happily, Miss Gordon," he
said, his voice full of underlying bitterness.</p>

<p>"You would have the rich to always wed the rich then?" she
said, smothering a long, deep, bitter sigh as she awaited his answer.</p>

<p>"Other things being equal&mdash;yes," he responded, cruelly, and for
a time they walked on silently through the moonlit paths with the
thick shrubberies casting fantastic shadows along their way. St.
Leon was in a savage mood, Laurel in a bitter one. She was silently
recalling her maid's favorite song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dimes and dollars, dollars and dimes!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An empty pocket is the worst of crimes.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If a man's down, give him a thrust&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Trample the beggar into the dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Presumptuous poverty is quite appalling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Knock him over! Kick him for falling!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dimes and dollars, dollars and dimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An empty pocket is the worst of crimes!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The popular creed&mdash;why should I try to fight against it?" she
asked herself, with a sinking heart. She looked up into the dark,
stern face beside her. "Then I need never ask you to feel sorry
for us&mdash;you will never help us to happiness&mdash;poor Cyril and me!"
she said.</p>

<p>His dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"You do not know what you are talking about, Miss Gordon!"
he said, almost savagely. "No; never ask me to help you to happiness
with Cyril Wentworth. I would sooner see you dead!"</p>

<p>She shrunk back appalled at his burst of resistless passion.</p>

<p>"He is hard and cruel, proud as Lucifer, and cold as ice," she
sighed, inly. "I was mad to dream that he called me darling in
my sleep! One of those stars will sooner fall from the heavens than
that he should descend to Laurel Vane!"</p>

<p>They were at the foot of the marble steps now. Just touching
her arm, he led her up to the door, and turned away.</p>

<p>"You may go in alone and tell them the ridiculous finale to our
grand scare&mdash;that you had simply fallen asleep on the grass," he
said, in a brusque, careless tone. "I shall go down to the river
and smoke my cigar."</p>

<p>And no wildest stretch of her girlish fancy could have made her
believe that St. Leon Le Roy went back to the place where he had
found her sleeping; that he took into his hands some of the scattered,
forgotten flowers, on which her arm and cheek had lain; that
he kissed them, and hid them in his breast, and then&mdash;almost cursed
himself for his folly.</p>

<p>"I, St. Leon Le Roy, whom the fairest, proudest women in the
world have loved vainly!" he cried, "I, to make myself a dolt over
another man's baby-faced, childish sweetheart!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>Laurel went slowly into the house and was received with joy
by Mrs. Le Roy and Clarice. She was touched when the proud,
stately lady kissed her warmly on the lips, and when she saw the
trace of tears in the dark eyes, she felt conscience stricken and
ashamed.</p>

<p>"She gives all this tenderness to Beatrix Gordon, the daughter of
her old friend," she thought sadly. "If she knew the truth, she
would hate me." "I am sorry and ashamed to think that I have created
a sensation for nothing," she said, with frank shame. "The
truth is I fell asleep in a secluded part of the grounds, and I do not
know when I should have awakened if Mr. Le Roy had not found
me."</p>

<p>The maid said to herself that it was surely the most fortunate nap
her mistress had ever taken, for she had thus escaped meeting Mr.
Gordon's clerk. She little dreamed of that unfortunate meeting at
the gates of Eden that evening between Ross Powell and the false
Beatrix Gordon.</p>

<p>Laurel received the letter and the packet. She opened the latter
first, and found that it contained a beautiful set of pearls in a velvet-lined,
Russia leather case.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful gift," said Mrs. Le Roy, who was a critical
judge of jewels. "It is a pity we live so quietly at Eden; you will
have no chance to display them. I shall have to give a dinner-party
or a reception."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray do not&mdash;at least on my account," panted Laurel, growing
crimson, and frightened all at once. "I should not like it, indeed&mdash;that
is, I mean mamma would not. I have not come out yet,
you know."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear, I shall not do so unless you wish. I am
rather pleased that you do not care for it, for I am rather fond of
seclusion and quiet myself. But I fancied it must be very dull for
a pretty young girl like you," replied Mrs. Le Roy, kindly.</p>

<p>"Dull!" cried Laurel, with shining eyes. "I have never been so
happy anywhere in my life!"</p>

<p>But she said to herself that she would never wear the jewels, the
beautiful, shining, moon-white pearls, never! She would send them
at the first opportunity to the true Beatrix Gordon.</p>

<p>And while Mrs. Le Roy pondered delightedly over her impulsive
words, Laurel opened and read Mrs. Gordon's letter.</p>

<p>When she had finished, she sat for some little time in silence,
musing gravely, with her small hands locked together in her lap.</p>

<p>"Does your letter trouble you, Beatrix?" asked Mrs. Le Roy,
seeing how grave and anxious she looked.</p>

<p>The girl looked up.</p>

<p>"Mamma and papa are about to take a little Southern trip for the
benefit of mamma's health," she said. "Mamma dreads the beginning
of autumn in New York. The changeable weather affects her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
lungs unpleasantly. She has written to ask if I would like to accompany
them."</p>

<p>"I have received a letter of the same import from Mrs. Gordon,"
answered the lady. "She allows you to take your choice in the
matter&mdash;to go with her, or to remain at Eden with me until she returns."</p>

<p>Laurel gave her a wistful, inquiring glance from her expressive
eyes.</p>

<p>The lady interpreted it aright.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy if you elect to remain with me that long, my
child," she answered, cordially, in answer to that mute question.</p>

<p>"Then I shall stay with you. I do not want to go away from
beautiful Eden," cried Laurel, quickly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear, I am gratified by your preference," Mrs.
Le Roy answered, smilingly.</p>

<p>Little more than two months ago Mrs. Le Roy had been vexed beyond
measure at the intrusion of this stranger into her sacred family
circle. Now the girl's untutored graces had won their way into her
heart, and she saw with pleasure that St. Leon's first studied avoidance
of the intruder had given way to a mild toleration that sometimes
even relaxed into genial courtesy. The stately lady had her
own plans, and it was no part of them for Beatrix Gordon to leave
her now. She had written to Mrs. Gordon and confided her plans
to her, meeting with that lady's cordial approval. Their mutual desires
and plans for Beatrix boded no good certainly to Cyril Wentworth's
happiness.</p>

<p>Laurel's heart beat with sudden fear and dread when she heard
that Ross Powell was coming again to Eden; but Clarice gave her,
unperceived, a swift, telegraphic look implying that she would manage
that all right, and Laurel, confident in the cleverness of the
maid, felt her beating heart grow calmer and her nervousness subside.</p>

<p>When Laurel went to her room that night she wrote to Mrs. Gordon,
thanking her for the gift of the beautiful pearls, and expressing
her desire to remain at Eden during the Southern tour. Clarice,
who, in addition to her other accomplishments, was a clever chirographist,
copied this letter over into a clever imitation of Beatrix Gordon's
writing, and made it all ready for Mr. Powell when he should
call for it the next day.</p>

<p>Laurel did not appear at breakfast the next morning, and Clarice
carried her excuses to Mrs. Le Roy with the most innocent air in the
world. Her young mistress had contracted a severe headache from
her unwitting nap in the night air and dew the previous evening. It
was a very natural sequence. No one dreamed of doubting it. A
delicate repast of tea and toast was sent up to the sufferer who spent
the day on her soft couch in a darkened room, and was, of course,
quite too unwell to see her visitor when he called.</p>

<p>Ross Powell received the letters for Mrs. Gordon, and went away
without giving much thought to the fact that he had not seen Miss
Gordon. His mind was far more exercised over the fact that he had
been utterly unable to find Laurel Vane.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Gordon was not sorry that her daughter had preferred to
stay at Eden in preference to accompanying her upon her Southern
tour. It augured well for the success of the trembling hopes which
she entertained in common with Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p>She sent down a letter full of affectionate regrets over their temporary
separation, and followed it by a box full of new dresses and
hats over which Clarice went into ecstasies of delight, and Laurel
wept.</p>

<p>"I can never wear them&mdash;do not ask me, Clarice," she said.
"They make me feel like a traitor. It is enough that I have borrowed
Miss Gordon's name. I cannot take the nice things they sent
her, too. I should feel like a thief."</p>

<p>"La me! my dear, I never saw anybody equal to you for calling
a spade a spade," cried pretty Clarice. "Now, I think you are too
hard upon yourself, really! You will have to wear some of these
pretty things to keep up appearances as Miss Gordon. The things
you brought with you, and the few dresses Miss Beatrix spared you
from her wardrobe are getting shabby, and I'm afraid these proud
rich people here think that your pa dresses you too poorly for your
station. Besides, this is September, and you cannot go on wearing
muslins and cambrics and nuns'-veiling all winter."</p>

<p>"I will wear them as long as I can, at least," sighed Laurel.
"Besides, Clarice, who can tell how soon our little comedy may be
played out&mdash;how soon Miss Wentworth may be ready to confess her
clever conspiracy?"</p>

<p>The quick-witted maid wondered a little at the note of vague regret
in Laurel's tone. The day came when she understood.</p>

<p>The time to which they looked forward came sooner than they
thought. In a week after the Gordons went South, a letter arrived
for Laurel under cover of an envelope addressed to Clarice Wells.
It was from Cyril Wentworth's fair young bride, who had been
hidden away securely in Brooklyn all this time, her husband pursuing
his daily occupation in New York, and returning in the evening
to his sweet stolen bride, no one ever suspecting that the handsome
young bachelor, whom the Gordons dreaded so much, had become
a Benedick.</p>

<p>"My sweet little Laurel," wrote grateful, happy Beatrix&mdash;"the
time of your long probation is at last over. My husband has at last
been offered that lucrative business tour abroad, for which my father
has been plotting so cleverly ever since he started me to Eden to hide
me from my darling Cyril. It's a splendid chance for a young man
in Cyril's position. It will insure us a competence, if not a fortune.
Oh, Laurel, my heart is singing pæans of gladness over our happy
prospects! I cannot be grateful enough to you for playing your
part so well, until this happy conclusion! Only think, dear&mdash;in
three days we sail for Europe. I shall need Clarice to go with me,
and I want you to come, too, Laurel. Cyril is not rich, but we will
care for you, my darling, and you shall be like my own little sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
until some fortunate man claims you for his lovely bride. You and
Clarice must come at once, dear, as we have no time to lose, and
Cyril has already taken our passages on the steamer. I sold my diamonds
to pay for them, so you may know by that, little Laurel,
how anxious I am to have you come. Do not delay. Invent some
clever excuse for leaving, and come at once to my address in Brooklyn.
You need not own up to our little conspiracy, dear. I know
you would be too frightened. Leave that to me. When we are on
the eve of starting, I will write to the Le Roys, and to papa and
mamma, confessing all and imploring their forgiveness."</p>

<p>Clarice went almost wild over that letter. She was full of joy that
the clever little conspiracy had worked out so successfully, and the
promised tour to Europe was the realization of the dream of her life.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that we can invent any good excuse for leaving
Eden," she said, thoughtfully. "They would not allow us. Mrs.
Gordon's orders have been too strict. We must steal away to-night,
Miss Vane, and we can telegraph them to-morrow to send our luggage.
Do you not think that will be the better plan to get away?"</p>

<p>She looked at Laurel, who had never spoken one word yet. The
girl was crouching in a low seat, like one overwhelmed with sudden
grief. She lifted a white face full of desperate trouble, and somber,
heavy, dark eyes up to Clarice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clarice, do not ask me," she wailed. "I do not want to
go! I cannot, I will not leave Eden."</p>

<p>And with that passionate denial, Laurel Vane's little feet turned
aside into that luring path of sin whose roses hide so many cruel
thorns.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>"I do not want to leave Eden," repeated the dead author's daughter,
passionately. "Do not ask me, Clarice! I will not go!"</p>

<p>Clarice Wells gazed at the pale face and somber dark eyes in
alarm. Had this sudden good news turned the young lady's brain?</p>

<p>She went up to Laurel and shook her gently by the arm.</p>

<p>"Miss Vane, I do not think you understand," she said; "your
probation here is over. We do not need to keep up this wretched
farce any longer. Mr. Wentworth has secured his fine appointment
abroad, and his wife wishes for us to go with her. Do you realize
it, Miss Vane? To go abroad&mdash;to be like the sister of Mrs. Wentworth&mdash;is
it not a glorious reward for the service you have done
her?"</p>

<p>But Laurel, gazing drearily before her into vacancy, answered obstinately:</p>

<p>"I understand it all, Clarice, but I would rather stay at Eden."</p>

<p>"But why, miss?" asked the maid, astonished and half indignant.</p>

<p>Laurel, glancing up, saw the wonder in her eyes, and suddenly
blushed a hot, burning crimson. The news had taken her by surprise,
and she had spoken out unthinkingly. On being confronted
with this very pertinent question from Clarice, she suddenly realized
her error.</p>

<p>"But why, Miss Vane?" persisted Clarice. "Why should you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
wish to stay at Eden when you are in danger of detection every
hour?"</p>

<p>"I love the place. I would rather risk detection than go away,"
faltered Laurel, miserably.</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> surprised," declared the maid, in genuine consternation.
"I thought you were miserable here, and that you would rejoice
to get away. I cannot see what has changed you so. It isn't
possible, Miss Vane," a sudden suspicion darting into her mind,
"that you have lost your heart to the master of Eden?"</p>

<p>Speechless and shame stricken, Laurel hid her hot face in her
hands, and Clarice went on, admonishing:</p>

<p>"If you have, you had best come away with me and think no
more of it, my dear young lady. Loving a man like Mr. Le Roy
mostly means ruin and destruction to a poor girl like you. If you
stay, they will be sure to find you out, and then what is to become
of you? These proud Le Roys will be fit to kill you for deceiving
them so. You had better go and fling yourself into the river yonder
than waste your heart on Mr. St. Leon Le Roy."</p>

<p>Laurel sprung to her feet, her small hands clinched, her dark eyes
suddenly blazing.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she cried. "How dare you accuse me of loving St.
Leon Le Roy? It is false. I never dreamed of such a folly. I
will not have you talk so to me, Clarice! Is there no reason I should
want to stay but that I cared for him? Do I not love his grand,
beautiful home? Do I not love the stately lady who has been so kind
to me? I would rather be Mrs. Le Roy's servant than go away!"
ended beautiful Laurel, wildly.</p>

<p>"She would not have you for her servant even, if once she found
out the truth about you," argued sensible Clarice. "Miss Vane, I
do not know what to think of this sudden fancy of yours. What
would Miss Beatrix&mdash;I mean Mrs. Wentworth, say if she could hear
you?"</p>

<p>"Clarice, I have served her ends and she can have no right to reproach
me if I take my own way now," said the girl. "And indeed
it is far better for me not to go. Mr. Wentworth is a poor man.
Why should I burden him with my support? They will do better
without me. Oh, Clarice, dear, kind Clarice," she flung herself
suddenly on her knees before the perplexed maid and grasped her
dress imploringly, "let me have my way in this! Go to Mrs. Wentworth
and leave me here! Beg her not to betray the conspiracy yet.
Tell her to be kind to me, to let me stay as long as I can before they
find me out in my wickedness!"</p>

<p>"And then," said Clarice, gravely, "what will you do after
that?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;the deluge," Laurel answered, recklessly.</p>

<p>They spent an hour in heated argument. Laurel was desperately
resolved not to leave Eden, if possible. Her tears, her prayers, conquered
Clarice's better judgment. The end of it all was, that Clarice
gave in to her plans, and promised to influence Beatrix Wentworth
to withhold her promised letters of confession to the Gordons and
the Le Roys.</p>

<p>"But I must say one thing, Miss Vane, in spite of your anger,"
said the maid, sturdily. "If you have laid a plan to marry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
master of Eden, I will betray you if it is at the front of the altar.
You must not dare carry the farce that far! You are beautiful and
young; but you are no mate for the proud, rich master of Eden.
If you married him and he found out the cheat afterward, he would
make you the most wretched woman under the sun!"</p>

<p>Afterward, Laurel recalled the maid's words as if they had been
some fateful prophecy, instead of the wise utterance of a clear-headed
woman.</p>

<p>"You need not threaten me, Clarice," she said, with girlish dignity.
"I have laid no plans&mdash;not one. I have not thought about
the future. I only could not bear to go away. I know Mr. Le Roy
could never think of me&mdash;<i>that way!</i> I&mdash;have never even dreamed
of it. Do not judge me so harshly, Clarice. Remember how young
I am. Is it strange that I should love the only happy home I ever
had?"</p>

<p>Clarice could not resist her beauty, her pleadings, her distress.
She smoothed the golden hair tenderly, and kissed the white hands,
and admitted that she was sorry for Laurel Vane. But she said to
herself, all the same, that she was acting wrong in leaving the girl
at Eden in her borrowed plumes. Harm would come of it&mdash;harm
to the beautiful, willful creature who was so blindly rushing upon
her fate.</p>

<p>That evening Laurel told Mrs. Le Roy that Clarice had received
an offer to accompany a lady to Europe, and that the girl had determined
to accept it, and would leave her on the next day to go to
New York.</p>

<p>"You shall have my own maid to help you every day until you
find a new one," said Mrs. Le Roy, cordially: and Laurel, thanking
her, said that she did not require the services of a maid very much,
and she would not engage another until she returned to New York.</p>

<p>Clarice Wells went away the next morning full of joy at the prospect
before her, but regretful at leaving Laurel. She fancied that the
girl would fare but ill at the hands of the Le Roys when they found
her out.</p>

<p>Laurel sent the beautiful pearls, Mrs. Gordon's gift, to Beatrix
Wentworth with her love and best wishes.</p>

<p>The maid declined to take the new hats and dresses to her mistress.</p>

<p>"You will need them if you are going to keep up this masquerade,"
she said. "And when they turn you adrift upon the world you
can sell them for money to buy food and shelter."</p>

<p>She went away, and in the new loneliness that fell upon her,
Laurel Vane began to realize dimly to what imminent perils she had
willfully committed herself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Clarice had barely gone a week, when one evening Mrs. Le Roy
came sailing into the dressing-room, whither Laurel had gone to
dress for dinner, but was dreaming instead at the open window.</p>

<p>"My dear, we have company from New York," she said, rather
abruptly.</p>

<p>Laurel started and turned a pale, frightened face toward the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"New York," she faltered, tremblingly, with her heart on her
lips.</p>

<p>A moment ago she had been careless, almost light hearted, as she
leaned from the window and watched the shadows of twilight falling
on the river and the beautiful grounds. She had inhaled the flower-scented
air with something like delight. She had been murmuring
to herself some pretty lines of Jean Ingelow's:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I leaned out of window, I smelt the white clover,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dark, dark was the garden, I saw not the gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, if there be footsteps, he comes, my one lover&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Hush, nightingale, hush! O, sweet nightingale, wait<br /></span>
<span class="i15">Till I listen and hear<br /></span>
<span class="i15">If a step draweth near,<br /></span>
<span class="i15">For my love he is late."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The murmured words of the love-song had died on the sweet lips
now. They were white with fear as she turned to Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p>"My child, you need not look so startled," she laughed. "My
guests will not eat you."</p>

<p>Then Laurel knew that she had almost betrayed herself. She
rallied her sinking spirits with a great effort of will.</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> rather startled. When you said New York I thought of
so many whom I knew," she said, apologetically. "Is it any one
who&mdash;knows me, Mrs. Le Roy?" she asked, quivering with secret
fear.</p>

<p>"No, my dear; but it is a lady who moves in the highest circles
of fashionable society in New York&mdash;an old friend of mine and St.
Leon's&mdash;a beautiful young widow she is now. She ran down quite
informally upon us to bring a friend&mdash;a titled foreigner&mdash;to see our
beautiful Eden." Laurel began to take heart again now. She
listened with a smile, while the lady continued: "You will not take
it amiss in your mother's old friend, Beatrix, if I suggest that you
make your dinner toilet more elaborate than usual? You are always
lovely, dear"&mdash;seeing the pale cheeks crimson suddenly&mdash;"in
the simplest things you wear; but, to do honor to our guests and
justice to your own rare beauty, I want you to look your loveliest
to-night. I want to help you select a robe from among the new
ones your mother sent&mdash;may I, dear?" with a coaxing smile.</p>

<p>"They do not fit&mdash;they are all too large, I think," faltered
Laurel.</p>

<p>"I will send my maid. She can make the necessary alterations
in a few minutes. I am waiting, dear, to help you select your robe,
if you will allow me," said Mrs. Le Roy, with gentle persistence.</p>

<p>And Laurel had to yield.</p>

<p>They looked through the dresses and selected one of white nun's-veiling,
satin and Spanish lace&mdash;simple enough for a young girl, yet
exquisitely elaborate and becoming.</p>

<p>"If you will wear this with the beautiful pearls your mother sent,
you will be simply peerless," said Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p>Laurel could not confess that she had sent the pearls away. When
Mrs. Le Roy was gone, and the maid was altering the dinner-dress,
she slipped out and gathered her hands full of deep scarlet jacqueminot
roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will not these roses look well with the white dress?" she asked
the stylish French maid, rather timidly.</p>

<p>"Superb!" pronounced mademoiselle, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>And when the dress was on, and the great clusters of scarlet roses
gleamed against the white breast, and in the rippling curls of burnished
gold, the maid could not repress an exclamation of delight.
Nothing could have been lovelier than the dark-eyed, golden-haired
girl in the white dress with the fragrant scarlet roses. Mademoiselle
did not know that the girl hated herself with a passionate contempt
as she looked down at her beautiful, borrowed plumage.</p>

<p>"'Fine feathers make fine birds,'" she said to herself, bitterly,
as she went down the stairs to the brilliantly lighted drawing-room,
holding her small head high to hide the tremor at her heart.</p>

<p>She opened the door and entered. Mrs. Le Roy was there talking
to a handsome young man. Beyond them she saw St. Leon
with his dark head bent over a beautiful woman at the piano. Her
white, jeweled hands flew swiftly over the pearl keys, and she was
singing to him in a high, clear soprano voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, my lost love, and my own, own love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my love who loved me so!"<br /></span>
</div></div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>Laurel drew back on the threshold, fearful of interrupting the
singer, but Mrs. Le Roy had already perceived her, and came forward
with considerable <i>empressement</i> to draw her into the room and
introduce her.</p>

<p>"Miss Gordon, Count Fitz John," she said, and with a gasp as if
some one had thrown cold water over her, the false Beatrix Gordon
found herself bowing to a real, live French count.</p>

<p>Her trepidation passed away in a moment. The count was not at
all imposing&mdash;a good-looking young fellow enough, but St. Leon Le
Roy overtopped him by head and shoulders in size and manly beauty.
Laurel sat down, shyly conscious of his palpable admiration,
and when the song had come to an end she was presented to the
singer.</p>

<p>A shimmer of azure silk, a gleam of jewels, a waft of overpowering
perfume, and Laurel dared raise her eyes to the beautiful blonde
face with its turquois blue eyes, its pink cheeks, and smiling lips,
a halo of pale golden hair framing it all and lending an air of infantile
innocence to its beauty. She looked very young, and she
was smaller than Laurel&mdash;a wax doll, dainty and diminutive, and
with a smile as sweet and inane. She did not look like a widow. It
seemed strange to call her <i>Mrs.</i> Merivale.</p>

<p>The blue eyes, for all their infantile softness, gave Laurel a piercing
take-you-in-at-a-glance look, as they touched each other's hands.</p>

<p>"A dark-eyed blonde&mdash;labeled dangerous!" said Mrs. Merivale
to herself enviously, and feeling for a moment doubtful over the
effect of her own elaborate costume as compared with this pure
white robe with its vivid garniture of roses.</p>

<p>But, in a moment, her natural vanity reasserted itself. She concluded
to be gracious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so glad to know you, Miss Gordon. I have heard of you
in New York, although rumor did not credit you with half the
charms I find you in actual possession of," she twittered, sweetly.
"Will you come to the piano and play for us? I am so fond of
music?"</p>

<p>"I do not play," Laurel answered, feeling the warm color flood
her cheeks under the lady's astonished gaze.</p>

<p>"Not play! Why, surely&mdash;" began Mrs. Merivale, but to Laurel's
intense relief dinner was announced, and she was spared the
expression of the lady's surprise at her ignorance.</p>

<p>Yet she looked at the pearl keys longingly as she swept past the
grand piano on the count's arm. She had a great passionate love
for the divine art of music, and a great grief filled her soul at the
thought that her hands had no power to wake the soul of harmony
slumbering in those silent keys.</p>

<p>"Poor papa! I wish that he had taught me more of music and
less of languages," she thought, regretfully.</p>

<p>Yet, when at dinner they talked in the French language out of
compliment to the polite count, she was glad that she could hold
her own among them. She felt rather than saw, St. Leon's surprise,
and Mrs. Merivale's dismay.</p>

<p>"So she can speak French like a native, although she cannot play&mdash;curious!"
said the latter to herself, with a feeling of vexation, for
she had started the ball of French conversation with a distinct view
to Miss Gordon's discomfiture.</p>

<p>Laurel had never seen Mr. Le Roy so brilliant as he was this evening.
It seemed that he had never exerted himself for her. He was
affable, courteous, fascinating to his visitors, especially so to the
lady. He had softly spoken words for her winning smiles that Laurel
had never dreamed could curve those sternly set lips. A pang of
bitterness pierced the sensitive heart of the lovely young impostor.</p>

<p>"He has never thought Beatrix Gordon worthy of his kind words
and smiles," she thought.</p>

<p>He did not think so now it seemed. He did not speak to her, seldom
looked at her. His words and looks were lavished on the fair,
smiling widow who gave herself up to the flirtation with eager, absorbing
interest. The count paid great attention to Laurel, and she
tried to look interested in his conversation, but she was glad when
the dinner was ended and the ladies passed from the room, leaving
the gentlemen to finish their wine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merivale went to the low window and looked out upon the
moonlit balcony.</p>

<p>"How lovely it is!" she cried. "Will you come out, Mrs. Le
Roy?&mdash;you and Miss Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Beatrix may go&mdash;I am afraid of the night air," Mrs. Le Roy
responded, settling herself in an easy-chair.</p>

<p>"Will you come, Miss Gordon?" asked the fair widow. "It
is too lovely a night to remain indoors," she added, sentimentally.</p>

<p>Laurel went out to her, and Mrs. Merivale drew her ringed hand
lovingly through the girl's arm.</p>

<p>"Let us go out and gather some roses with the moonlight and
dew upon them. They will be so sweet," she said, winningly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"And, please, will you call me Maud, and let me call you Beatrix?
We are both too young to be ceremonious with each other."</p>

<p>They went down into the graveled paths where the September
moonlight shone clear and white, and then Maud Merivale seemed to
forget all about the roses.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma chère</i>, I am dying to know how you like the count!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"He is very nice, I suppose," said Laurel, vaguely, her thoughts
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"'Very nice'&mdash;oh, dear, what faint praise for my gallant adorer!"
laughed the lady. "Why, my dear Beatrix, all the girls in New
York vote him a love, a darling, an Adonis, and above all, a splendid
catch! They are all jealous of me! Any one of them could willingly
cut my ears off for having taken him captive!"</p>

<p>"Then you are to marry him?" said innocent Laurel, taking a
vague pleasure in the thought as suggested by the lady's words.</p>

<p>"<i>Cela depend.</i> I can marry him if I choose," laughed the lady.
"You must have observed how devoted he is."</p>

<p>Laurel had <i>not</i> observed it; but she wisely said nothing.</p>

<p>Maud Merivale shook her golden frizzes in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I shall not marry him. It is useless his breaking his heart over
me," she said. "I am too true to my old love."</p>

<p>"Your dead husband," Laurel said, gently.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Beatrix"&mdash;impatiently&mdash;"what are you talking of? Do
you not know that Mr. Merivale was an old man? It was not at all
a love match: it was because he was rich."</p>

<p>"Pardon," Laurel murmured, faintly, and she recalled to herself,
as she often did, Clarice's favorite song of "Dollars and
Dimes."</p>

<p>"It is all right. The old man died soon, and left me a fortune,"
said the young widow, heartlessly. "But as for loving him, or
having any sentimental <i>tendresse</i> over his memory&mdash;pshaw, I am
not such a little simpleton as that, my dear! no one could expect
it," plaintively. "Beatrix," this with startling suddenness&mdash;"tell
me what do you think of your host&mdash;of St. Leon Le Roy?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>The change of conversation was so sudden that Laurel started
and shivered uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Are you cold, my dear?" asked Maud Merivale.</p>

<p>"I felt chilly for a moment," Laurel answered. "It does not
matter. You were saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I asked you what you thought of St. Leon Le Roy, Beatrix. Is
he not"&mdash;enthusiastically&mdash;"grand, handsome, noble&mdash;a very king
among men?"</p>

<p>Little thrills of icy coldness shot along Laurel's tingling nerves.
She remembered his cold, proud bearing to her, as contrasted with
his winning and tender demeanor to Maud Merivale that evening.
She answered with impulsive bitterness:</p>

<p>"He may be all that to you, Mrs. Merivale, but to me he has always
seemed cold, hard, stern!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor St. Leon!&mdash;ah! I know who warped his generous nature
so," sighed the lady. "Beatrix, I am so fond of you I have a mind
to tell you my story&mdash;mine and St. Leon's."</p>

<p>They paced back and forth in the fine, clear moonlight, their rich
robes shining in the night: the fragrance of flowers all about them;
the sound of the river in their ears. A hand of ice seemed to clutch
Laurel's heart in its fierce grasp. She could find no words in which
to answer.</p>

<p>"You have heard that we were old friends, St. Leon and I&mdash;they
have surely told you that, dear," went on Maud Merivale's sweet,
insidious voice. "Beatrix, in the olden times, we were more than
that&mdash;we were lovers."</p>

<p>"Lovers!" echoed Laurel's low, sad voice.</p>

<p>"We were lovers," repeated Mrs. Merivale, in a tone of triumph.
"But we were both very young, and&mdash;well, old Midas Merivale was
even richer than St. Leon. My parents were poor, and so they parted
me from my young lover and sold me to that old man for his sordid
gold."</p>

<p>There was a plaintive quiver in the cooing voice, and Laurel's
heart suddenly went out to the lovely victim in tender sympathy.</p>

<p>"After my marriage I did not see St. Leon for years," continued
the sweet tones. "But they told me he had changed&mdash;that he had
grown hard, cynical, cold&mdash;that he cared nothing for women save to
rail at them. But I am free at last&mdash;and you see for yourself that he
unbends to me as to none other. The old love still burns in his
heart. I shall win him back, Beatrix, and this time no one shall
come between us!"</p>

<p>"Maud," called a strong, sweet voice, coming down the marble
steps.</p>

<p>"I am here, St. Leon," she answered back, gladly. "This pretty
Beatrix here promised me some roses all sweet with moonlight and
dew, but she has not given me one. You shall give them to me, St.
Leon."</p>

<p>He came out to them, his handsome dark head bare in the moonlight,
a smile in his eyes and on his lips&mdash;subtly sweet and dangerous
as he sometimes willed it to be.</p>

<p>"Miss Gordon, will you go into the house with the count and
my mother?" he said, looking straight into the girl's dark eyes. "I
will find the roses 'all sweet with moonlight and dew.'"</p>

<p>Laurel bowed silently and turned away. She did not turn her
head, but she knew that the widow had taken St. Leon's arm and
was walking across the velvety greensward with him. The echo of
firm tones and happy laughter floated back to her.</p>

<p>She did not go back to the count and Mrs. Le Roy as she had
been bidden at once. She sat down at the foot of the marble steps
and laid her hot brow wearily down on the cold white stone.</p>

<p>"Their words hurt me here," she murmured, pressing her small
hand on her beating heart. "But I cannot understand why it
should be so. Why should their love pain me? I care nothing for
either of them. They are nothing to me. But, oh! this terrible
pain at my heart&mdash;what does it mean?"</p>

<p>The slight form shivered and trembled, the beautiful face was
deathly white in the moonlight. She rested there silently a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
time, looking down with sharpened mental vision into her own
heart.</p>

<p>And suddenly a moan of intense self-scorn and bitter despair
trembled over the beautiful girlish lips.</p>

<p>"I have been willfully blind; I have not understood till now,"
she moaned. "But, by the flash of jealousy and grief, I have seen
my heart. Clarice was right, and I spoke falsely when I denied her.
I love him&mdash;that haughty, handsome man, who has never given me
one thought&mdash;who belongs to Maud Merivale. That is why I
risked all to remain at Eden! Oh, God! how hard it is to read my
own heart first by its jealousy and aching!"</p>

<p>And the night winds and the river echoed her faint, despairing
moan.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>After a little she dragged herself up wearily, and went back to
the drawing-room. The young count brightened visibly at her appearance.
Mrs. Le Roy told her that she had stayed out too long in
the night air and dew.</p>

<p>"You look as cold and white as the moonlight," she said.</p>

<p>Laurel made her some careless answer and sat down. Count Fitz
John engaged her in conversation. He was delighted to find some
one who could converse fairly in his native tongue, and he never
wearied of gazing on her rare type of beauty, and her tasteful dress
that appealed so forcibly to his artistic eye. He admired her, perhaps,
all the more that she piqued him a little by her quietness and
girlish dignity. She was not flattered by his notice as other girls
were. On the contrary, if he had not been rather self-conceited,
he must have seen that she was decidedly bored.</p>

<p>St. Leon and his fair guest came in almost an hour later. Laurel
did not look up at their entrance, though she felt her cheeks growing
hot, with the bitter wonder that was in her mind.</p>

<p>Did St. Leon Le Roy suspect that she cared for him? Had he
fathomed the secret of her heart before she really understood it herself?
Was that the secret of his coldness, his almost harshness to
her? Had he used</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"This rough discourtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break or blunt her passion?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The hot color flashed into her sensitive face. She tried not to
hear his clear, firm voice, as he talked to Mrs. Merivale. To drown
those tones, she was obliged to listen attentively to the count, and to
talk more herself. She roused herself to almost vivacity. She
<i>would</i> be gay. No one should guess how her heart was bleeding.
She succeeded so well in her efforts that the Frenchman was delighted.
He thought that he had at last begun to make an impression
on the lovely girl, and Laurel, never glancing toward the others
did not know with what a frowning brow St. Leon watched her
apparent coquetries.</p>

<p>But the interminable evening was over at last. Laurel could
never have told how she got through it, but at last they had all gone
to their rooms, and Laurel stood before the long glittering mirror in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
her dressing-room gazing with sad eyes and trembling lips at the
face reflected there as at a new creature&mdash;a girl who for three months
had been living a strange unconscious love-dream, and who had
first found out that she had a heart by its bitter aching.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why did she love him? Curious fool, be still;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is human love the growth of human will?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Self-scorn and self-pity struggled together in her heart. She felt
with a great throb of bitter shame that she had given her love unsought,
unvalued, and to another woman's lover. Maud Merivale's
words rang in her ears:</p>

<p>"I shall win him back, and this time no one shall come between
us."</p>

<p>"He belongs to Maud Merivale. What matter? He never could
have been mine," she said, to the white-faced, dark-eyed girl gazing
back at her from the mirror with the red roses dying on her breast.</p>

<p>Yesterday she had been reading in a book in the library some
pretty verses written over just such a mad and foolish love as this
of hers. A fancy seized her to read them again in the light of this
new revelation that had flashed upon her heart.</p>

<p>"I will slip down to the library and bring the book," she said,
gliding out into the hall and down the broad stairway, shrinkingly,
like a little white ghost.</p>

<p>The library was deserted, but the shaded reading-lamp still
burned over the center-table with its litter of books and magazines.</p>

<p>The marble busts and statuettes against the book-lined walls
looked grimly down upon her, this fair, golden-haired girl with
that look of tragic sorrow on her pale face.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> has been here," she murmured, softly, noting the faint fragrance
of cigar smoke that pervaded the air.</p>

<p>She sat down in the great cushioned reading-chair and then she
saw another token of his presence&mdash;a knot of golden pansies he had
worn in his button-hole that evening, and which now lay carelessly
on the floor at her feet. She would never have guessed that he had
thrown them there in passionate disdain because Maud Merivale's
hand had pinned them on his breast.</p>

<p>Laurel picked up the poor dying flowers and held them tenderly.</p>

<p>"You have been near the rose," she murmured, and pressed
them to her lips in sudden, passionate love and sorrow. She could
not help it. They spoke to her so plainly of the proud man who
had won her heart all unwittingly. They made her think of the
princely form, the dark, luring, splendid face, the proud, cynical,
dark eyes, the curling lips like that once or twice only she had seen
curved into a beautiful smile, subtly sweet and dangerous, which
women had worshiped blindly, but which only shone upon them to
betray their hopes to ruin.</p>

<p>She held the flowers, kissed them again and again, then threw
them far from her in a sudden revulsion of feeling bordering on
supreme self-contempt.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I could throw my hopeless passion from me thus lightly,"
she sighed.</p>

<p>She found the book she wished, and, tempted by the deep silence
and quiet of the room, decided to remain awhile at least. With her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
fair head resting on her arm she began to read aloud softly, after an
old habit of hers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'You walk the sunny side of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wise world smiles and calls you great.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The golden fruitage of success<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drops at your feet in plenteousness;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And you have blessings manifold;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Renown and power and friends and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They build a wall between us twain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That may not be thrown down again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! for I the long time through<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have loved you better than you knew.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly a sweet, chilly breath of night air blew over her. She
looked up and saw St. Leon Le Roy parting the heavy curtains of
silk and lace at the bay-window behind which he had been quietly
sitting smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>Bewildered, startled, Laurel threw down her book and sprung up
in ignominious flight.</p>

<p>The master of Eden coolly caught her hands and forced her back
into her seat.</p>

<p>"Why need you always fly from me as though I were an ogre?"
he said, plaintively. "I shall not eat you, child, tempted as I might
be to do so."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought myself alone," she stammered, crimsoning under
his mocking raillery.</p>

<p>"There is no harm done," he answered, drawing up a chair in
front of her and gazing at her with the same slow, sweet smile he
had worn when he bade her return to his mother and the count that
evening. "I was smoking at the window when you first came in,
and I thought at first I would be still and not disturb you, thinking
you would go in a moment. But you stayed, and&mdash;I changed my
mind."</p>

<p>Fancying some covert meaning in his words, she answered,
quickly:</p>

<p>"But it is late, and indeed I must be going upstairs now."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"No, it is not late&mdash;at least, not midnight. Surely you can spare
me a few minutes, Miss Gordon. I wish very much to speak to
you," he said, almost gravely.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine why you should wish to speak to me," she
began, tremulously.</p>

<p>"Cannot you?" laughing. "Well, suppose I have a mind to
lecture you on your frivolity, Miss Gordon? Do you know, I never
dreamed what an egregious flirt you were until I saw you bringing
the whole battery of your charms to bear on that fascinated Frenchman
this evening? Why have you never condescended to me likewise?"</p>

<p>"I deny the imputation. I am not a flirt," she answered, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then you were in earnest&mdash;worse still!" he said, in that light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
mocking tone, with his piercing eyes on her burning face. "Beatrix&mdash;pardon,
Miss Gordon&mdash;what would Cyril Wentworth say to
that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! It is no more concern of his," she flashed out, passionately
unconscious of the sudden joy that flashed into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have broken with Wentworth?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, coldly.</p>

<p>He regarded her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Do you know that he is gone away?" he asked, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"To Europe&mdash;yes, but I do not care!" she answered, out of the
recklessness of her despair.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you love him no longer&mdash;that it was a mere
child-fancy that absence has cured?" St. Leon asked her, anxiously.
She gave him a swift, half-angry glance from her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I do not know why you should presume to question me so," she
said, with a little flash of pride. "But I will answer you, Mr. Le
Roy. Yes, it was a mere childish fancy, and I am effectually cured
of it. I know now that I never loved Cyril Wentworth in my life."</p>

<p>He bowed his handsome head in graceful acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Your frankness emboldens me to ask another confidence," he
said. "Miss Gordon, tell me the story Mrs. Merivale poured into
your sympathetic ear this evening."</p>

<p>She drew back, indignant and amazed.</p>

<p>"Would you ask me to betray a woman's sacred confidence?"
she cried.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud&mdash;harshly, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"Do you call <i>that</i> confidence which is poured into every stranger's
ear? That figment of Maud Merivale's crafty brain?" he cried.
"Tell me the pretty fiction she gave you, Miss Gordon, and then
you shall hear my side of the story."</p>

<p>"If you wish me to congratulate you, Mr. Le Roy, I will do so
now without waiting to hear more," she said, desperately, eager to
escape this painful interview.</p>

<p>He caught her hand as she half arose, and gently forced her back
to her seat.</p>

<p>"Do not leave me yet," he said. "Pshaw! I know her pitiful
stereotyped story! We were lovers once and her parents parted us
and sold her to an old man because he was richer than I! Is not
that the amount of the pretty idyl, Miss Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;I have heard it often before. Now hear my side
of the story, child. We were lovers in our young days&mdash;that is true.
You would not believe that Maud is thirty, would you, Miss Gordon?
My mother thought me too young to marry then, and besides,
she did not wholly approve of my choice. The end justified her.
We postponed the consummation of our bliss until I should come of
age. Maud grew impatient. Old Midas Merivale met her, and&mdash;pardon
the wretched slang, Miss Gordon&mdash;she 'went for him' and
threw me over! To-night," he resumed, after a moment's pause,
"she threw prudence and delicacy to the winds, begging me to forgive
her and to take her back to my heart&mdash;swore that she had never
ceased to love me. Can you guess what answer I made her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she faltered, thrilling with interest.</p>

<p>"I told her that since her sin I had scorned all women for her
sake&mdash;<i>her</i> most of all! I told her that never until now had I met a
woman who redeemed the sex in my eyes&mdash;a child woman so fair,
so innocent, so frank and truthful, that falsehood could not breathe
the same air with her&mdash;one to whom I gave the strong, passionate
love of a man combined with the reverence due to an angel."</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms to her yearningly, his face transfigured
with his mighty love.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, I am twice as old as you are, but I love you to madness!
I have hated Cyril Wentworth in my bitter jealousy, but that
is all past. Thank God, you love him no longer&mdash;you are free!
Can you love <i>me</i>, Beatrix? Will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>Laurel Vane almost reeled with the suddenness of this perfect joy
that had come upon her. She was face to face with the great
temptation of her life, but, oh, how powerless, through her passionate
love, to fight against it!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Deep emotion overpowered Laurel's speech for a moment. Her
lips parted as if to speak, but closed again without a sound. Her
fair head drooped like a beautiful flower too heavily laden with
dew. It had come upon her like a great shock that St. Leon Le
Roy loved her&mdash;loved her, the false Beatrix Gordon, the perjured
girl living a deliberate lie beneath his roof. She called it by its
worst name to herself, even though she flinched from it, for she
had, as Clarice Wells said of her, a habit of calling things by their
right names. To her a "spade" was a "spade." She had the
moral courage to recognize her sin, but this love had made her a
coward. She could not confess the truth. For the sake of this man
she had risked all. She could not put his love from her now. Yet
his next words stabbed her with keenest pain.</p>

<p>"For the first time, Beatrix, I feel like thanking God for Maud's
falsity, since it has left me free to win you, my true, angel-hearted
girl!"</p>

<p>"True! angel-hearted&mdash;oh, my God!" she shuddered to herself,
and a longing came over her to be all that he thought her, honest,
innocent, true. Should she confess all, and trust to his great love
to pity and pardon her?</p>

<p>She lifted her dark, wistful eyes to his glowing, eager face.</p>

<p>"If you had not loved me perhaps you would have forgiven the
wrong Mrs. Merivale did you," she said, anxiously.</p>

<p>The stern lines she dreaded came around his lips again.</p>

<p>"I forgave her long ago&mdash;as long ago as my fancy for her died!"
he said. "But I can never respect her, nor even like her again.
She deceived me. I can never forget that! Women should be little
lower than the angels, Beatrix.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A perfect creature, nobly planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To warn, to comfort, and command,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>Wordsworth's ideal is mine, Beatrix. I could never again love a
woman who had deceived me. Once fallen from her lofty pedestal,
the broken idol could never be restored again!"</p>

<p>He was unconsciously warning her, but he only frightened her.
She said to herself that he would never forgive her if she told him
at this late day how she had deceived him. And she could not do it.
She would not risk it. She loved him too dearly. She would have
his love while she could, whether it lasted for a year or a day.</p>

<p>"Why did you deceive her this evening?" she asked, gaining
courage as she made her wild resolve. "You were so devoted and
attentive she thought she had won you back."</p>

<p>His scornful laugh was not good to hear.</p>

<p>"That was my revenge," he said. "I fooled her to the top of
her bent, while I laughed in my sleeve at her credulity. She should
have known me better, yet she came down here with the deliberate
intention of winning me back. She did not find St. Leon the boy
who was blinded by her beauty, she found Le Roy, the man who
saw through her shallow arts and despised her." She had no answer
ready and he went on more slowly after a moment: "Shall I
confess that I had another motive too, Beatrix? I longed to pique
you if possible. Since you came to Eden you have been cold, shy,
frightened of me always. I confess that I gave you room at first,
but I soon became interested in you and would have repaired my
error if you had let me. But you did not. You treated me with a
distant, respectful civility, as if I had been as old as my mother.
When Mrs. Merivale came I determined to show you that I was not
too antiquated to admire fair women and to be admired by them.
But you held your own so bravely, you flirted so charmingly with
Count Fitz John that I was completely blinded and half maddened
by your indifference. Ah, my darling," he bent toward her with a
flash of triumphant love in his splendid eyes, "if you had not come
in here to night, I should never have dreamed, never have known&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard&mdash;you saw?" she broke in, hot and red with bitter
shame. "Oh, I could sooner have died!" hiding her burning face
in her small hands.</p>

<p>"Hush, Beatrix." He drew the trembling hands away, put his
arms around her tenderly, and pillowed the flushed face on his
breast. "It was a happy chance, my love. Do not regret it for my
sake. Do not think I spied upon your actions, darling. I did not
mean to disturb you, only I could not forbear peeping through the
curtains and feasting my eyes on your sweetness. So it came to pass
that I heard and saw&mdash;that which made me the happiest of men!"</p>

<p>"You take it for granted that I&mdash;that you&mdash;" she began to remonstrate,
incoherently, with a mutinous, trembling pout upon her sweet
red lips.</p>

<p>"That you belong to me&mdash;that I may ask you for your love&mdash;since
you have broken with Wentworth&mdash;yes," he answered, full
of happy faith. "Is it not true, Beatrix, my beautiful, dark-eyed
love? Will you not be my cherished little wife?"</p>

<p>And paler than the marble statue that glimmered coldly white in
the shadowy corner yonder, she murmured:</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Full of boundless trust and passion he bent down and pressed a
lingering, passionate kiss on the lips of the beautiful impostor.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my little love," he said, huskily, and with deep
<i>empressement</i>, "you shall never regret that sweet promise."</p>

<p>He meant to keep his word, but we mortals are so blind. The day
came when she felt that all her life was one long regret!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, that word regret!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There have been nights and morns when we have sighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let us alone, Regret! We are content<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To throw thee all our past, so thou wilt sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For aye.' But it is patient, and it wakes!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It hath not learned to cry itself to sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But plaineth on the bed that it is hard."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dizzy with passionate love and happiness, she rested in his arms a
moment, then drew herself shyly away.</p>

<p>"It grows late. Indeed, I must leave you now," she whispered.</p>

<p>"It is late and you are weary," he said, tenderly. "I must send
you to your rest, my precious one, but for me I shall sit here all
night rejoicing over my sweet, new happiness."</p>

<p>They had heard no step in the hall, but at that moment the door
swung open and Mrs. Merivale appeared on the threshold in an exquisite
dressing-gown, her loosened golden hair flying over her
shoulders. She gazed in dismay for an instant, then started backward
with a quick smile of scorn.</p>

<p>"Pardon! I could not sleep, and came for a book. I did not
dream of interrupting such an interesting midnight <i>tête-à-tête</i>," she
said, sneeringly.</p>

<p>St. Leon drew his arm gently around the slight form of his betrothed,
an ominous gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Congratulate us, Mrs. Merivale," he said, "Miss Gordon has
promised to be my wife."</p>

<p>The snaky fire of hate flashed in greenish sparkles from the eyes
of the disappointed woman.</p>

<p>"With all my heart. May you be as happy as you deserve," she
answered, scornfully.</p>

<p>Then, turning to go, she bent swiftly toward Laurel Vane and
whispered in her ear with the hissing tone of hate:</p>

<p>"You have triumphed over me&mdash;you have come between us, but
do not forget that '<i>Who breaks&mdash;pays!</i>'"</p>

<p>"An omen," Laurel sighed to herself.</p>

<p>He was loath to let her go when the jealous, angry woman had
disappeared. The pale, frightened face touched his heart. He
made her tell him what Maud Merivale had hissed in her ear.</p>

<p>"A mere idle threat," he said. "She can do you no harm,
Beatrix. You are too secure in your high position as Mr. Gordon's
daughter and my promised wife for her hate to touch you. As the
mistress of Eden you will be socially her superior, for old Midas
Merivale made his millions in trade, and the Le Roys have inherited
their wealth from several generations of blue-blooded ancestors.
Indeed, we trace our origin from the French nobility."</p>

<p>Everything he told her only frightened her worse. She trembled
at her presumption in entering this family which prided itself less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
on its great wealth than on its noble pedigree. She silently recalled
some verses she had read that evening:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I knew that every victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But lifted you away from me;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That every step of high emprise<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But left me lowlier in your eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I watched the distance as it grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And loved you better than you knew!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"He counts his ancestors back to the French nobility, while I do
not know what my grandfather's name was," said Louis Vane's
daughter to herself.</p>

<p>"Before you go, my darling," said St. Leon, suddenly, "there is
one thing I should like to hear you say."</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is," she answered.</p>

<p>He took both her trembling hands in his and looked deep into her
eyes with a piercing gaze that seemed to read her soul.</p>

<p>"Lift up your head, Beatrix, look straight into my eyes, and say,
'St. Leon, I love you.'"</p>

<p>Blushing "celestial, rosy red," she obeyed his fond command,
and there was a depth of pathos and passion in her voice of which
she was herself unconscious.</p>

<p>"St. Leon, I love you," she repeated from the depths of her adoring
heart.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he caught her in his arms and strained her eagerly
to his breast. "Forgive me for calling out your blushes so, but
they are more lovely than your roses. Now good-night, my little
love, but do not speak another word. Let those last sweet words
live in my memory to-night."</p>

<p>He kissed her and put her gently from him, then stood at the door
to watch the little white figure going lightly along the hall and up
the wide polished stairway.</p>

<p>"Mine, mine, my little love!" he murmured, gladly. "How
pleased and happy my mother will be!"</p>

<p>He went back into the room, threw himself down into a chair,
and, true to his word, spent the remaining hours of the night in a
happy vigil, dreaming over the sweet, new happiness which had
come to him so strangely when his heart had been weighed down
by despair.</p>

<p>And Laurel Vane! She kept a wakeful vigil, too. Her eyes were
not so bright as they should have been next morning, her cheeks
and lips were not so rosy, but her beauty was as marked as ever, and
Count Fitz John was very loath to follow the angry, disappointed
widow back to New York that day.</p>

<p>"I not only found an Eden but an Eve!" he said to Maud, rather
disconsolately.</p>

<p>"You need not vex your heart over her, for she has found her
Adam in St. Leon Le Roy," she answered, bitterly.</p>

<p>When they were gone, St. Leon sought his mother.</p>

<p>"Congratulate me," he said. "The desire of your heart will be
granted. I am about to marry."</p>

<p>Her handsome, proud old face did not look as bright as he had
expected.</p>

<p>"You have chosen Maud Merivale again?" she said, and then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
understood the shadow on her face and the tone of regret in her
voice.</p>

<p>"You are still prejudiced against Maud!" he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"I have never forgiven her for the slight she put upon my son!"
she answered, gravely.</p>

<p>Laurel's slim young figure went flitting past the open door at that
moment. He called to her, drew the small hand through his arm,
and led her up to his mother.</p>

<p>"Mother, here is your daughter," he said, with the brightest
smile she had ever seen on his darkly handsome face.</p>

<p>"And Cyril Wentworth?" she asked, blissful, but bewildered.</p>

<p>"I have never loved him. It was only fancy. I have broken
with him forever!" answered the girl.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she cried, drawing her new daughter into her
arms and kissing her fondly; while she added to St. Leon, gladly:
"I am so glad it is our sweet little Beatrix, and not that odious
Maud Merivale!"</p>

<p>And that day she wrote a letter to Mrs. Gordon, telling her how
cleverly their plot had succeeded, and that St. Leon had taken Cyril
Wentworth's place in her daughter's heart.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>"Wooed and married and a'." How swiftly it all had followed
upon Laurel Vane's coming to Eden!</p>

<p>In June she had come to the Le Roys, a trembling, frightened,
innocent little impostor, lending herself to a fraud for Beatrix Gordon's
sake. From a most unwelcome intruder, whom they had received
with secret disfavor, she had come to be the light of their
eyes and their hearts. To-day&mdash;a fair, ripe day in October, with the
"flying gold of the ruined woodlands driving through the air"&mdash;she
clung to St. Leon Le Roy's arm, his worshiped bride, happy,
with a strange, delirious happiness, in spite of the sword that ever
hung suspended by a hair above her head&mdash;the sword that must
surely fall some day, and cause her destruction.</p>

<p>She was dizzy with the whirl of events that had brought about
this dazzling consummation.</p>

<p>In the first place, Mr. Le Roy had written to Mr. Gordon, announcing
his engagement to his daughter, and pleading for an early
marriage.</p>

<p>The publisher had replied, on the part of himself and wife, delightedly
sanctioning their darling's betrothal to Mr. Le Roy, and
permitting Beatrix to consult her own wishes in naming the day.
They wished only to make their darling happy, they said; and she
should, therefore, choose the earliest day that pleased her. Mrs.
Gordon wrote that she would soon come home to superintend the
preparation of the bridal <i>trousseau</i>.</p>

<p>Laurel was filled with dismay at the latter information. St. Leon,
noting every change of the fair young face with a lover's eye, was
quick to see the shadow.</p>

<p>"What is it, my darling?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We must postpone the wedding a long, long time," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
"Mamma must not curtail her Southern trip and lose the benefit
she is deriving from it. We must wait."</p>

<p>She felt like a hypocrite as she said it, but she was rendered desperate
by her fears. She knew that, with Mrs. Gordon's coming,
all was at an end, and she longed desperately to ward off the evil
hour. She was so wildly, deliriously happy now, she would stave
off the hour of reckoning as long as she could. Just to remain at
Eden as long as she could was all that she asked. It always seemed
to her quite impossible that she should ever become St. Leon Le
Roy's wife. The blow would fall before then. She felt that she
was only taking her pleasure like a butterfly in the sun, and that
the nipping blasts of winter would soon lop off her gilded wings
and leave her, crushed and trampled, beneath the scorner's heel.</p>

<p>Those joys that we hold by a frail, slight tenure we always prize
the most. This love that she was fated one day to lose had become
a part of Laurel Vane's life. She said to herself that, when she lost
it she would die.</p>

<p>It was a mad love that she gave her noble, princely looking lover.
She would have made any sacrifice for him except to tell him that
she had deceived him. She would have died for him if need be,
but death would have been easier than confessing her strange sin to
him.</p>

<p>St. Leon chafed sorely at the idea of waiting so long to claim his
bonny bride. They had talked of a bridal tour to Europe, and Laurel
had betrayed the most eager delight at the idea. The tour of Europe
had not the attraction of novelty to him. He had made it several
times, but he longed to gratify the girl's wish; he was so sure that
he would make her happy he could not bear to wait. And yet he
was not selfish enough to wish to hasten Mrs. Gordon's return at
the hazard of her health.</p>

<p>His mother agreed with him that it was unfortunate his having
to wait. She was very anxious to see him married to Beatrix Gordon,
and she thought the autumn a pleasant time for crossing the
ocean.</p>

<p>If they could only be married in October, how pleasant it would
be, but then the <i>trousseau</i>&mdash;it would take an endless time for that.</p>

<p>St. Leon displayed all a man's impatience under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"A fig for the <i>trousseau</i>! What could be prettier than Beatrix's
white dresses that she wore every day? But if she had to have no
end of new things, why couldn't they get them when they went to
Paris? Worth was the only man who could make them, anyhow.
Given a traveling-dress to cross the 'herring pond' in, and she
might have a hundred new dresses if she liked, once they landed in
France. Must a man wait months and months for his happiness on
account of some paltry dresses?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy, in her anxiety for the marriage, quite agreed with
him in his tersely expressed views. If Mrs. Gordon came home she
would order her daughter's dresses from Paris. How much easier
for Beatrix to get them herself while abroad!</p>

<p>She wrote to Mrs. Gordon and suggested the idea. Moreover,
she hinted broadly her fears that Beatrix, if let alone so long, might
change her mind&mdash;might return to the old love&mdash;no one could say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
when Cyril Wentworth would return to America, nor what effect
his return might have on his sweetheart. Mrs. Le Roy thought the
wisest plan, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, would be
for the Gordons to continue their Southern tour, and let St. Leon
marry Beatrix quietly, without any fuss or ceremony, and take her
abroad.</p>

<p>That clever hint about Cyril Wentworth had the intended effect
on the nervous invalid. All her old fears of Cyril Wentworth were
reawakened. A longing desire took possession of her to have her
daughter married off safely out of the fortune-hunter's reach. In
her sudden anxiety she would have had St. Leon and Beatrix married
that moment by telegraph if possible. She infected her husband
with all her own fears, and both concurred in the opinion of
Mrs. Le Roy that delays were dangerous.</p>

<p>So a letter went hastily back to Eden full of good tidings to the
dwellers there.</p>

<p>The Gordons approved and even advocated Mrs. Le Roy's plan.
They wrote to their daughter, and recommended her to shorten the
term of her lover's probation, regretting that the state of her mother's
health made it desirable for her to remain where she was yet
awhile longer. The letter was filled with such warm, parental love
and advice that Laurel involuntarily wept over it. A generous
check for her Parisian <i>trousseau</i> was inclosed. This the young girl
put carefully away.</p>

<p>"I shall never use it," she said. "Gold could not tempt me to
sin. It is love that has made me bad and wicked, but I cannot
draw back now. I shall marry St. Leon Le Roy. It is fate."</p>

<p>So, following that fate, she went recklessly on in her strange
career. Three weeks later she was no longer Laurel Vane, she was
Laurel Le Roy, almost forgetting in her wild happiness her enemy's
threat, "<i>Who breaks&mdash;pays!</i>"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>Days came in which Laurel almost forgot the long, dark, threatening
shadow that lay always just ahead of her.</p>

<p>They were crossing the wide Atlantic Ocean, and every one said
that there never had been finer weather or a pleasanter trip. They
had no rough winds the whole voyage. The calm, sunny blue sky
hung over an ocean as beautifully blue and almost as calm. The
foamy white caps of the waves were almost as fleecy and pure as the
snowy little clouds that sailed through the sky. The beautiful
shining-winged sea-birds were a source of beauty and delight to
every one. Every day was warm and sunny, every night was moonlighted
and balmy. No one had expected such perfect weather in
October.</p>

<p>Forever after those two weeks remained in Laurel's memory like
a beautiful dream, fadeless and ineffaceable.</p>

<p>For that little time she was perfectly secure. She knew no one
on the steamer, no one knew her. Her husband was perfectly devoted
to her as she was to him. They spent long, happy days together
on deck, never weary of each other's society. They talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to each other by moonlight, their talk often drifting into poetry,
which is the most natural language of love. They made some acquaintances,
but they did not seek other society. They were all in
all to each other. The girl-wife could not find it in her heart to repent
of what she had done. It appeared to her that she had been
made for him, and he for her, judging by their mutual love.</p>

<p>Certainly a change for the better had been effected in St. Leon Le
Roy. His dark eyes were no longer cold and cynical, but beamed
with love and happiness. The mocking smile no longer curled his
lips. They were sweet and gentle. His voice rang with tenderness
instead of sarcasm. His hatred and distrust for all women because
Maud Merivale had deceived him was gradually dying out. He believed
that his bride was an angel. When the awakening came, it
was all the more bitter because he had believed in her so truly.</p>

<p>Laurel was as lovely as a dream in those honeymoon days. Her
face glowed with happiness, her dark eyes lost their somber, brooding
shadow, and sparkled like stars.</p>

<p>The passengers said that Mr. Le Roy's young bride was a perfect
beauty. When she walked on deck in her soft, fine, white cashmere
dresses, with a crimson scarf about her shoulders, diamonds
blazing in her small, shell-like ears, and her splendid burnished
golden hair flying like a banner of light on the gentle breeze, no one
could keep from looking at her, no one could keep from envying
St. Leon Le Roy the possession of so much beauty, and sweetness,
and love.</p>

<p>Laurel had never known that she was beautiful until St. Leon
told her so. It was a new delight to her. Some faint hope came to
her that by that beauty she might hold his heart, even when he
found her out&mdash;even when he knew her at her worst&mdash;an impostor
who had masqueraded under a false name, and so won him. She
had read that "beauty is lord of love," and she prayed that it might
prove so to her in her dark hour&mdash;that hour always just a little
ahead of her, when she should moan:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"So tired, so tired, my heart and I!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though now none takes me on his arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fold me close and kiss me warm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till each quick breath end in a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of happy languor. Now alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lean upon some graveyard stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and I."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She would not think of that nearing future much. She gave herself
up to the delights of the present. She was the most fondly
worshiped wife in the world. When they went to Paris, he loaded
her with costly gifts, splendid dresses, priceless jewels.</p>

<p>"I do not know how I shall ever be able to wear all of these
splendid things; they are too fine for me," she said to him, almost
afraid of herself in the midst of this splendid paraphernalia.</p>

<p>"Nothing is too costly or too fine for you, my little love," he answered,
taking her in his arms and kissing the beautiful face over
and over. "You will need all these things when you go into society.
When we go home, we will spend our winters in New York,
and the women in society there dress like queens. I shall want you
to be the finest of them all, as you are decidedly the most beautiful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered why the fair face grew so pale, why his young wife
shivered in his arms, and drooped her eyes from his.</p>

<p>"I hope it will be a long time before we return to New York,"
she said, almost petulantly. "I like Europe better than America."</p>

<p>"You are a most disloyal subject of the United States," he
laughed: "but you shall stay as long as you wish, my darling."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>When they went to England, Laurel wondered a little tearfully
if they should meet the Wentworths. She knew that they were in
London, and the thought of coming upon them was not pleasant.
She did not think that Beatrix Wentworth would approve of what
she had done, and she recalled Clarice Wells' threat with an uncontrollable
shudder. It had been so vivid.</p>

<p>"I would betray you even in front of the altar!" had said the
maid.</p>

<p>Decidedly the thought of stumbling upon the Wentworths was
not pleasant.</p>

<p>"But then," said the trembling young bride to herself, "there
was no likelihood that they would do so. London was a great wide
city. They might stay there for years, and never stumble upon
these people of whom her guilty conscience made her feel so horribly
afraid."</p>

<p>Again, she remembered that Cyril Wentworth was here on business,
she and her husband in quest of pleasure. Their ways lay far
apart. There were no mutual aims and pursuits to bring them together.
It was decidedly unlikely that they should meet.</p>

<p>But some one has cleverly said that "The most unlikely things
always happen."</p>

<p>They had been in London several weeks, patiently "doing" all
the wonders of that wonderful city, when one day Mr. Le Roy took
his wife to a famous art gallery. She had developed a perfect passion
for fine pictures and statues, and he knew that she would be
charmed with the works of the old masters that were gathered in
this famous gallery&mdash;the Titians, Murillos, Guidos, Raphaels&mdash;all
the glorious men who, by brush or chisel, had handed down their
names to an immortal fame.</p>

<p>It was a bright day in December. The sun was shining, for a
wonder, in murky, foggy London, irradiating its usual "pea-soup"
atmosphere. St. Leon was delighted that the sun shone so brightly.
He knew that it would show the pictures to still greater advantage,
and he liked for his darling to have all her pleasures at their best.</p>

<p>Looking at Laurel you would never have guessed that until a few
months ago she had lived in cheap lodgings with her erratic father,
and tended their poor rooms with her own little white hands. She
looked as dainty and lovely as a little princess now, as she tripped
along by the side of her handsome, stately husband. The day was
cold, although the sun shone so brightly, and Laurel was wrapped
in a long cloak of shining seal-skin, with a pretty cap of the same
perched jauntily on her head, its long brown ostrich plume drooping
against her long golden curls, contrasting with their lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
tinge, which must have been a favorite shade with the old masters,
for St. Leon observed that they had painted it on the heads of their
most beautiful women.</p>

<p>"There is not a picture on the walls half so lovely as her living
face," he said to himself, exultantly, looking at the fair flower-face
with its full crimson lips, its oval outline, its wine dark eyes
with such wealth of jetty lashes softly fringing them, and the soft,
bright fringe of love-locks, shading the low, white brow. The
splendid diamond solitaires in her rosy ears flashed and sparkled
with every turn of the restless little head, and were wondrously
becoming to her style. It was no wonder that St. Leon's eyes
turned often from the changeless canvas to dwell in fondest admiration
on the living face full of the glow and flash and sparkle of
youthful beauty and happiness.</p>

<p>He told her that she was more beautiful than the pictured faces
on the walls, and her eyes flashed with joy, and her face flushed
rosily. She was so glad of the fairness God had given her, she
never wearied of hearing about it. It was the link by which she
hoped to hold her husband when he found out the truth about her.</p>

<p>She often asked herself anxiously which would be the stronger in
that terrible hour&mdash;his love or his pride&mdash;but she could never answer
her own question. She loved St. Leon, but she did not yet understand
him.</p>

<p>They were standing in front of a seraphic-looking Madonna, when
suddenly he touched her arm, and whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Some others are waiting to look at this, dear. Let us move on."</p>

<p>She turned her beautiful, happy face from the picture toward the
group who had just come up to them&mdash;a young lady and gentleman
with a trim maid following after, some rich, warm wraps over her
arm. They were Cyril Wentworth, his wife, and her maid Clarice.</p>

<p>The beautiful smile froze on Laurel's lips as she met their startled,
wondering gaze. She uttered a moan like one dying, and all in a
moment fell senseless on the floor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>More than once, since they came to England, Clarice Wells said,
anxiously, to her mistress:</p>

<p>"I am afraid Miss Vane has laid her plans to marry Mr. Le Roy.
Why else should she have wished to remain at Eden?"</p>

<p>But Beatrix, who was very fond of the lovely girl who had made
such a sacrifice for her sake, would not believe it.</p>

<p>"She was a dear, good, honest child," she said. "I had hard
work to persuade her to personate me for a little while. Her exaggerated
notion of gratitude was all that tipped the scale in my favor,
allowing a little for her romantic pity for two despairing lovers. I
am sure she would not attempt an intrigue at her own risk."</p>

<p>"One risks a great deal for love's sake," said Clarice Wells.
"You would know that by your experience, Mrs. Wentworth."</p>

<p>"But Laurel was not in love with Mr. Le Roy. She was afraid
of him. She wrote me to that effect," objected pretty Beatrix, fixing
her large blue eyes surprisedly on Clarice's sober face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. That might have been the case at first, but
it was not likely to last," said the maid, pursuing her argument with
the freedom of a favorite. "I do not believe Miss Vane's antipathy
lasted long. He was very handsome and fascinating&mdash;just the man
to win the love of an innocent young girl! And he admired her, I
am sure of that, Mrs. Wentworth. And believing her to be his
equal in wealth and station, what was there to prevent their marrying
if they loved each other?"</p>

<p>"You are very clever, Clarice, but I am afraid you are making
mountains of mole-hills," Beatrix Wentworth answered, lightly.
"How could they marry without papa and mamma's consent?
Beatrix Gordon would have to return to New York and be married
from her father's house. And how could little Laurel Vane, with
her big black eyes and innocent soul, personate me to my own
parents? Do you not see that your theory wouldn't hold water,
Clarice, as Cyril would say in his lively way."</p>

<p>Clarice was silenced, but not convinced.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I wish I had not left her there," she said. "My conscience
would be all the clearer. But, Mrs. Wentworth, don't you
think that you should write to your parents now and confess what
you have done, and beg them to forgive you for your naughty conspiracy
and runaway marriage?"</p>

<p>Two crystal drops brimmed over in Mrs. Wentworth's blue eyes
and splashed down upon her pink cheeks.</p>

<p>"Dear papa, dear mamma, it was naughty and wicked to desert
them so," she said; "but they were too hard upon Cyril and me.
I loved him so dearly. I could not bear it. But I loved them too;
and although Cyril makes me so happy, my heart aches for the dear
ones at home."</p>

<p>"And you will write to them? The plunge has to be made some
time. As well now as ever," urged the maid.</p>

<p>"No, not now. What do you take me for, Clarice? Do you
think I would betray sweet little Laurel, to whom I owe all my
happiness?" cried Beatrix, indignantly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for naming it. Of course, you know best,
Mrs. Wentworth," replied discreet Clarice, dropping the subject.</p>

<p>They had discussed the matter several times, each retaining her
own opinion of the matter on the well-known principle that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A woman convinced against her will<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is of the same opinion still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beatrix, like most adoring young wives, who confide all they
know to their husbands, laid her grievance before Cyril.</p>

<p>The handsome, happy young Benedick humbly begged his wife's
pardon for coinciding with Clarice's views rather than hers, but he
could not be shaken from his first opinion that the romance of the
conspiracy would culminate in the marriage of St. Leon Le Roy and
Laurel Vane.</p>

<p>"It would be a delightful ending," he said, laughing at her horrified
face.</p>

<p>"But I tell you it would not," she said, emphatically. "It
would be just too dreadful for anything, and I will not believe it
of sweet little Laurel Vane!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope she may justify your good opinion, my dear," said Cyril
Wentworth, dryly, but kissing her fondly, and loving her all the
more for her boundless faith in her fellow woman.</p>

<p>But they dropped the subject then, and if any one speculated
further on Laurel Vane's hopes and plans it passed in silence.
Beatrix was too generous to believe evil of the innocent girl who
had served her in her clever counterplot against her parents. She
loved Laurel for all she had done for her. When the shock of the
truth came upon her it was all the harder to bear because of the
loving faith she had persistently cherished.</p>

<p>That bright December day Cyril went home to their neat, pretty
lodgings and announced that he had a holiday.</p>

<p>"It is such a lovely day, I should like to take you out somewhere,
darling," he said, smoothing the bright waves of her golden
hair with caressing fingers. "You know it is not often that I have
the chance to escort you anywhere in the day."</p>

<p>They discussed duly the important subject of where to go, and
decided on an art gallery. Both adored pictures.</p>

<p>Clarice dressed her mistress in her silks and furs and decided to
follow the party with extra wraps for her mistress in case the day
should prove colder than they thought, and in order to gratify her
own penchant for sight-seeing.</p>

<p>No thought came to them of the great surprise that awaited them
in the famous art gallery. They went forward to meet it all unconsciously,
even as Laurel awaited their coming among the pictures
and statues, all unconscious of what was hastening to her.</p>

<p>They were unusually gay. Beatrix had been pining a little of
late under the depressing influence of the rainy, dismal weather.
The bright sunshine revived her spirits and brought the warm pink
roses to her cheeks. She laughed and chatted gayly to her delighted
husband.</p>

<p>They loitered in the gallery and admired the beautiful paintings
and statues, all the work of master hands long since dissolved to
dust. They saw only two persons besides themselves&mdash;a lady and
gentleman with their faces turned toward the beautiful painting of
a Madonna. The lady had golden hair that was strangely familiar
to Beatrix and Clarice, but then, many of the Englishwomen had
golden hair. Each said to herself that it was only fancy that it reminded
them of Laurel Vane.</p>

<p>So they went on slowly and unconsciously, and the handsome man
and beautiful girl turned around and faced them.</p>

<p>They saw the young face whiten with fear, heard the frightened
moan break from the trembling lips, saw her reel dizzily, and fall
like a stone at their feet&mdash;and they knew that this was Laurel Vane,
that St. Leon Le Roy was her husband, and that her wretched falsehood
had found her out!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Le Roy, turning in the same moment with his wife, saw
two faces that he recognized&mdash;Cyril Wentworth's that he had seen
once in New York, and Clarice's, which he remembered perfectly
well. Beatrix he did not know. He glanced at her carelessly, little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
thinking what an influence the pretty blonde had exerted over his
life.</p>

<p>A pang of jealousy, keen, swift, and terrible as the lightning's
flash tore through his heart as he beheld his worshiped bride
waver and fall, like one dead, to the floor.</p>

<p>He believed that the mere sight of Cyril Wentworth's face had
produced that terrible emotion that had stricken her down like a
broken flower at their feet.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood motionless, almost petrified by his agitation,
then he bent down over the beautiful face that only a moment
ago had been lifted to his sparkling and glowing with love and happiness.
It was pale and rigid now, and the jetty fringe of the lashes
lay heavily on the white cheeks as if they would never lift again
from the sweet dark eyes.</p>

<p>Quick as he was, light-footed Clarice was before him. She was
kneeling down loosening the furs and laces about the throat of the
unconscious girl with deft, easy fingers. She looked up at him with
a strange glance.</p>

<p>"It is only a faint," she said, "but she may be some time in recovering.
You had better go out and bring <i>eau de Cologne</i>."</p>

<p>He obeyed her like one in a dream, and the moment he was gone
quick-witted Clarice borrowed Mrs. Wentworth's <i>vinaigrette</i>.</p>

<p>"I only sent him out on a pretext," she said. "We must get
her revived before he returns. Mr. Wentworth, will you please remove
her gloves and chafe her hands? No, perhaps your wife
might do it better," she added, with a quick afterthought.</p>

<p>Beatrix had been clinging to her husband's arm, staring like one
dazed at the strange scene. She knelt down and drew off Laurel's
dark kid gloves and chafed the delicate, dimpled, white hands. She
saw a broad gold wedding-ring on the slender finger of one small
hand, guarded by a keeper of magnificent diamonds and rubies.
All three looked significantly at one another, and Clarice said,
woman-like, to her mistress:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wentworth, I told you so."</p>

<p>Cyril could not repress a slight laugh as he stood gazing down
upon them. His keen perception told him the truth.</p>

<p>"It is Laurel Vane," he said, and Beatrix answered, "Yes," in
a dazed tone, while the maid supplemented quickly, "Or rather
Laurel Le Roy."</p>

<p>At that moment Laurel shivered and opened her eyes. She saw
herself supported in Clarice's arms, while Beatrix, kneeling by her,
chafed her small hands. They saw her glance wander past them
yearningly, and a moan of pitiful despair came from her white lips
as she missed the face she sought.</p>

<p>"You fainted, and Mr. Le Roy has gone out for some <i>eau de Cologne</i>,"
said the maid.</p>

<p>A touch of color came into the blanched face. She turned her
dark, frightened eyes up to their cold faces.</p>

<p>"You have betrayed me!" she said, in a faint, almost dying, tone.</p>

<p>Beatrix seemed incapable of speech.</p>

<p>Clarice answered, coldly:</p>

<p>"We have said nothing yet!" Then she continued, gravely:
"Miss Vane, are you Mr. Le Roy's wife?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I am his wife," Laurel answered, faintly. And she tore
her hands from Beatrix, and covered her face with them.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment, then Clarice asked, slowly:</p>

<p>"Did you deceive him to the end?"</p>

<p>"To the bitter end!" shuddered Laurel, in a hollow tone.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she let the shielding hands fall from her burning
face, and looked at Beatrix.</p>

<p>"Do not look at me so sternly and coldly, Mrs. Wentworth," she
cried. "You sent me there. Are you not to blame?"</p>

<p>No one could have believed that Mrs. Wentworth's gentle face
could grow so hard and cold.</p>

<p>Laurel Vane had so bitterly betrayed the trust she reposed in her
that she did not know how to forgive her.</p>

<p>"Do not charge me with your folly, your madness!" she cried,
indignantly. "My sin was bad enough&mdash;but yours is beyond pardon.
How dared you, <i>Laurel Vane</i>, marry the proud, rich St. Leon Le
Roy?"</p>

<p>"I loved him&mdash;he loved me!" moaned the wretched young bride.</p>

<p>"And what will become of his love now when he learns the
truth?" queried Beatrix, with stinging scorn.</p>

<p>Cyril hastily interposed.</p>

<p>"Do not be hard on her, Beatrix. She was kind to us. Be kind
to her. See, she is almost heart-broken by your scorn!"</p>

<p>Laurel looked at the handsome, kindly face. It was full of sympathy
and pity, not hard and angry like the women's faces. Her
despairing heart filled with new hope. She clasped her hands, and
looked at him with dark, appealing eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I pitied you, I helped you to your love," she said, pleadingly.
"Will you let them rob me of mine? Will you let them betray
me?"</p>

<p>All the pity in his heart, all his manly compassion was stirred into
life by her words and looks.</p>

<p>"We love each other," she went on, pathetically. "We love
each other even as you and your wife love. Do not come between
us yet! Let us be happy a little longer!"</p>

<p>"Beatrix, you hear," said Cyril, bending down to take his wife's
hand in his own. "They love even as we love, dear. Can you
bear to part them&mdash;to betray her? She is little more than a child.
You will break her heart. The beginning of it all lies with us. Do
we not owe her our pity at least&mdash;our pity and our silence?"</p>

<p>"Your silence&mdash;that is all I ask," cried the culprit, eagerly.
"The end will come soon enough. Let me have a little respite.
Tell me where to find you to-morrow. Mr. Le Roy has an engagement
out then, and I will come to you. I will tell you how it all
happened! I will beg for your pity on my bended knees!"</p>

<p>She began to weep passionately. Beatrix could not bear those bitter
tears. She drew out her card-case hastily.</p>

<p>"Here is my address," she said. "Come to me to-morrow, and
tell me the whole story. I can judge better then what is best for me
to do."</p>

<p>She did not pity Laurel much. She felt angry with her for her
presumption in marrying one so far above her as Mr. Le Roy. And
then the folly, the madness of it. She could not understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mad love that had driven Laurel, step by step, into her terrible position.</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Roy is coming. Do not let him suspect anything
wrong," said Cyril, hastily.</p>

<p>He turned with a smile to meet the handsome, stately gentleman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Roy, I am Cyril Wentworth," he said, genially. "Permit
me to assure you that your wife is quite recovered, and to present
you to my wife&mdash;Mrs. Wentworth."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>"Married!" said St. Leon to himself, with a start, and a quick
glance at Beatrix. He bowed to her gracefully, then hurried to his
wife's side.</p>

<p>"You are better, Beatrix?" he said, anxiously, and they all saw
his passionate heart looking out of the beautiful eyes he bent on her
pale and tear-stained face.</p>

<p>She clung to him in a sort of nervous terror and fear.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am better, thanks to the goodness of Clarice and her
mistress," she faltered. "You must thank them for their kindness
to me, St. Leon, and take me away."</p>

<p>He obeyed her request in a few courteous words, bowed to the
party, and led his wife away, outwardly cool and collected, but on
fire with jealous pain.</p>

<p>"She loves him still! She fainted at the bare sight of him!" he
muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"My God! why did she marry me, then? Was it for wealth
and position?"</p>

<p>The bitter doubt tore his heart like a knife. An unconscious
coldness grew up in his heart toward her.</p>

<p>He placed her silently in the carriage, and, springing in beside
her, gave himself up to bitter reflections.</p>

<p>The carriage whirled them away to their hotel, and as it rattled
over the streets Laurel watched her husband's cold, grave face with
wonder.</p>

<p>"What is it, St. Leon?" she asked him, slipping her arm timidly
in his. "Why do you look so grave?"</p>

<p>"I am puzzled," he answered.</p>

<p>"Over what, St. Leon?" asked the beautiful girl.</p>

<p>"Over your fainting spell," he answered, moodily. "You told
me you had ceased to love Cyril Wentworth, but at the bare sight
of him you fell like one dead. What am I to think, Beatrix?"</p>

<p>It came over her like a flash, that he was jealous of Cyril Wentworth&mdash;of
Cyril Wentworth, whom she had never beheld until to-day.</p>

<p>How she longed for him to know the truth, to tell him that she
had never loved mortal man save him whom she called her husband!
But it was one of the pains and penalties of her position that she
could not confess to St. Leon. He must go on believing that her
first pure love had been lavished on another, must go on doubting
her, for his looks and words assured her that the first seeds of jealousy
had been sown in his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Hot tears of pain and humiliation gathered in her eyes and
splashed heavily down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, St. Leon, you do not, you cannot, believe that I love him
still?" she sighed.</p>

<p>"Why, then, your agitation at that chance meeting?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I was startled&mdash;only that," she answered. "It was like seeing
a ghost. And you must remember there was Clarice, too. I assure
you I was more startled at the sight of her than by Mr. Wentworth.
It was a nervousness, agitation, fright, what you will, St. Leon,
but not love. No, no, no, not love! I love you only, my husband.
You are the life of my life!"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands around his arm, and looked up to him with
dark, pathetic eyes.</p>

<p>"I am not perfect, St. Leon," she said, "and life is not all sunshine.
Some day the heavy, lowering clouds of fate will pour out
their blinding rain upon our heads. You may believe many hard
things of me then, St. Leon, but you may be sure of one thing always,
dear. I love you now and I shall love you forever, with the
maddest, deepest passion a woman's heart can cherish!"</p>

<p>He had never heard her speak with such passion before. Her love
had been like a timid bird brooding softly in her heart, too shy to
soar into the sunlight, but the words burst from her now eloquent
with her heart's emotion, and made sacred by the burning drops
that fell from her eyes. He could not but believe her. The jealous
misery fled from his heart as he clasped her in his arms and kissed
the trembling rosebud mouth.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, darling, for doubting you," he said, repentantly.
"It was because I love you so dearly, and I have always been so
absurdly jealous of Cyril Wentworth. I would give anything upon
earth to be able to say that you had never loved any one but me."</p>

<p>And she could not tell him that it was true. It was a part of her
punishment that this dark shadow&mdash;the thought that her first love
had been given another&mdash;should never be lifted from his life. She
knew that it was a pain to his jealous nature, but her lips were
sealed. Some day he would know the truth, she said to herself bitterly,
but then it would come too late for his happiness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>"I loved him, Mrs. Wentworth. That is all my defense. Call
me weak, cowardly, wicked, if you will; but I could not put the
temptation from me. Think what all my life had been&mdash;how dull,
how sad, how lonely! Was it easy to put away happiness when it
came to me in so fair a guise?"</p>

<p>The white hands were clasped imploringly, the dark eyes were
lifted pleadingly as the sad words fell from Laurel's lips. Beatrix
Wentworth and Clarice Wells, her judges and accusers, looked
gravely upon the tortured face of the culprit&mdash;the fairest culprit
that was ever arraigned for her sin.</p>

<p>"Do you call it happiness?" said Beatrix Wentworth. "I
should not think you would know one happy hour, living on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
verge of a volcano that may destroy you at any moment. I should
think that your sorrow and repentance would almost kill you."</p>

<p>"But I do not repent!" cried Laurel desperately. "I shall never
repent while I remain with St. Leon. I am too happy, in spite of
my fears, for sorrow or repentance. When I am torn away from
him, when I have lost his love, then I shall repent, then I shall understand
the depths of my dreadful sin; but never before!"</p>

<p>They looked at her in wonder. They could not understand her.
Surely she was mad&mdash;the glamour of passion had obscured her reason!</p>

<p>"And when the end comes&mdash;when he has put you from him&mdash;what
will you do then, poor child!" asked Beatrix, slowly.</p>

<p>"Then I shall die," the beautiful girl answered, despairingly.</p>

<p>And again they did not know what to say to her. She had no
thoughts outside of this love that she held by so slight a thread.
She could see nothing beyond it but death. Beatrix could not help
feeling vexed with her. She loved her own young husband with a
fond, romantic love, but she could not comprehend the madness of
Laurel's devotion.</p>

<p>"It is not so easy to die, Laurel," she said, impatiently. "You
are a woman now, and you must not answer me like a child. Your
sin will find you out some day, and you will perhaps be cast adrift
on the world. You should have some plans formed for that time."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; then Laurel murmured, tremblingly:</p>

<p>"St. Leon loves me&mdash;perhaps he will forgive me."</p>

<p>Clarice Wells gave an audible sigh from her corner. Beatrix murmured,
"Poor child!"</p>

<p>And the mistress and maid looked at each other in silence a moment.
They did not know how to deal with this nature. Both
wondered in themselves if St. Leon Le Roy would indeed forgive her
falsehood. They did not think so.</p>

<p>Beatrix toyed nervously with the tassels of her pale-blue morning
dress.</p>

<p>"Laurel," she said, after a moment. "Clarice and I have formed
a plan for you. We do not want to betray you to your husband.
We think it would be better it you confessed the truth to him yourself."</p>

<p>They never forgot how deathly white she grew, nor how wild and
frightened the dark eyes looked. She threw out her hands as if to
ward off a blow.</p>

<p>"Confess to St. Leon? Why, I would sooner die!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child," remonstrated Beatrix, "he would be far
more likely to forgive you if you confessed to him yourself than if I
betrayed you."</p>

<p>"You will not do that, oh, you will not do that! You could not
be so cruel!" gasped Laurel, throwing herself impulsively at Beatrix's
feet. "Oh, Mrs. Wentworth, I helped <i>you</i> to happiness! Do not
rob me of mine!"</p>

<p>Clarice raised her gently and replaced her in her seat.</p>

<p>"You have not heard all my plan out, Laurel," said Beatrix.
"I do not forget my debt to you. I would sooner help you than
betray you. I was going on to say that if you would be brave
enough to confess to St. Leon how you have wronged him, I too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
would confess to him. I would tell him how much I was to blame.
I would beg him to forgive you because you were so innocent and
ignorant, and because you loved him so. Then&mdash;if it came to the
worst&mdash;if in his pride and his wrath he should put you away from
him&mdash;you might come to us&mdash;to Cyril and me."</p>

<p>The hapless young creature did not answer a word. She stared
at Beatrix mutely with wide, wild eyes like a hunted fawn's.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say, Laurel?" inquired Beatrix. "Will you
do as I wish you?"</p>

<p>"It is too terrible a risk. I do not dare," moaned Laurel, hiding
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Then for a time there was silence. Beatrix was hurt and
chagrined that her plan had been discarded. She thought Laurel
was a headstrong, willful child, rushing blindly upon her own destruction.</p>

<p>But she could not help pitying the girl, her fear and misery were
so great. She desisted from advising her. It seemed too much like
torturing some lovely, helpless creature. The hunted look in the
dark eyes pained her.</p>

<p>"After all, is she any worse than I am?" said Beatrix to herself.
"I deceived my parents. I risked everything for love's sake, and
this poor child has done no more than that. I must not be angry
with her. I must remember always that it was I who led her into
temptation."</p>

<p>She went to her gently, she took the white hands from the pale,
tear-stained face, and held them kindly in both of hers.</p>

<p>"Laurel, do not look so miserable and heart-broken," she said,
gently. "You need not be afraid of me."</p>

<p>Laurel looked at her with a flash of hope in her humid eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you will not betray me?" she panted.</p>

<p>"I will not betray you," Beatrix answered. "I pity you too
much, my poor child, and I know that the end will come soon
enough. Far be it from me to hasten the evil hour."</p>

<p>She was glad she had spoken so kindly when she saw the lovely
flush of joy that came into the sensitive face. Laurel thanked and
blessed her passionately, then the dark eyes turned to Clarice.</p>

<p>"And will you have mercy on me, too?" she said. "I have always
been afraid of you, Clarice. I have always remembered what
you said. The words have haunted me."</p>

<p>"I meant what I said," replied the maid. "If I had seen you
going to the altar with him, I should have betrayed you, and saved
him. It would have been my duty."</p>

<p>"And now?" Laurel questioned faintly.</p>

<p>"It has gone too far," answered Clarice. "You are Mr. Le
Roy's wedded wife. What God hath joined together, no man must
put asunder."</p>

<p>She thanked them with such trembling passion and joy that they
could have wept.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether I am doing right," said Beatrix. "But
I am very happy, and I remember always that you helped me to my
happiness, and that I thoughtlessly led you into temptation. I will
keep your secret, Laurel, and may God help you when your hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
reckoning comes, as it too surely will, my poor child, sooner or
later."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>Laurel was fortunate enough to get back to her hotel before Mr.
Le Roy returned from his engagement with the friend whom he had
unexpectedly encountered in London. She removed her street dress
immediately, and he never suspected the momentous visit she had
made that morning to Cyril Wentworth's wife. She was gay and
loving, as usual, and he dreamed not what bitter tears had dimmed
her eyes that morning in her fear that he would find her out in her
sin.</p>

<p>But that night she said to him, with pretty impatience:</p>

<p>"When are we going to leave London, St. Leon? I am very
tired of the rain and the cold."</p>

<p>"I thought you had not done sight-seeing yet," he said, a little
surprised at her capriciousness. "There are many places of interest
which you have not visited yet."</p>

<p>"I am tired of it all," she declared. "One wearies of the rain
and the smoke and the fog. I should like to go to Italy, where the
sun shines all day, and the air is balmy and warm. Will you take
me, St. Leon?"</p>

<p>"We will go to-morrow, if you wish," he replied. "There is
nothing to detain us in London."</p>

<p>"To-morrow it shall be!" cried Laurel.</p>

<p>He humored her caprice and took her to Italy. She did not
breathe freely until she was out of London. She was horribly
afraid of meeting the Wentworths again.</p>

<p>They hired a charming little villa in Southern Italy, and lived
there several months, leading a beautiful, idyllic life that charmed
Laurel. She called the pretty place Eden, in loving memory of her
home.</p>

<p>Letters came often from Mrs. Le Roy, occasionally from the Gordons.
Mrs. Gordon was not fond of letter-writing, and though she
loved her daughter dearly, she wrote to her but seldom. These letters
Laurel always posted to Beatrix Wentworth in London with her
own hands. She felt sure that Beatrix would understand and be
glad to receive them.</p>

<p>By dint of earnest application she had acquired a very fair imitation
of Mrs. Wentworth's writing. But her conscience always reproached
her when she answered those fond, parental letters. She
always felt the burden of her guilt most deeply then. So her letters
were brief and infrequent. But the Gordons thought nothing of it.
Beatrix had never been a diffuse writer, and they supposed she was
all absorbed in her happiness now. Laurel never expressed the least
desire to return to America. Mr. Le Roy was rather amused at her
persistent preference for the Old World.</p>

<p>One thing pleased Mr. Le Roy very much while they remained in
Italy.</p>

<p>His wife developed a sudden taste for music. She regretted that
she had never learned the piano. Masters were procured for her at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
her own desire, and for one who had professed not to care for music,
her progress was exceedingly rapid.</p>

<p>When summer came they wearied of Italy, and went to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Ah, those happy days abroad&mdash;that long, sweet honeymoon! It
was so heavenly sweet, it was no wonder that Laurel could not repent
of the fraud by which she had won her splendid husband. Life
was a dream of Elysium.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love took up the glass of time, and turned it in his glowing hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She was beginning to feel almost secure in her happiness, when
one evening the shadow fell, as it always falls, unexpectedly, on her
life.</p>

<p>She had come down dressed for an opera to which her husband
had promised to take her, and she was looking her loveliest. Her
robe of white silk and pink brocade was exquisitely becoming, and
she wore great flashing diamonds on her round white throat and
arms. She had never looked lovelier, but St. Leon did not notice
her radiant beauty. There was a shadow on his dark, handsome
face. He came and put his arms around the beautiful figure, crushing
it against his breast, reckless how he rumpled her dainty laces.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, my darling, I have bad news," he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She started, and uttered a cry. Her lips grew livid, she seemed to
shrink in the fond arms that held her.</p>

<p>"Do not be frightened, my love," he said. "We will hope for
the best."</p>

<p>"What is it?" she gasped through her dry, parched lips.</p>

<p>"I have received a cablegram from America. My mother is very
ill. We must return home immediately," he said, in a voice shaken
by anxiety and emotion.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>He had expected that Beatrix would be startled and distressed,
but he was not prepared for the burst of emotion with which she received
his news.</p>

<p>"Home! home!" she burst out, in a voice that was like a wail of
despair, then suddenly flinging her arms about his neck, she broke
into tempestuous sobbing as if the very depths of her heart were
stirred by throes of keenest anguish.</p>

<p>He was touched and startled by this display of affectionate grief
for his mother. Never had he clasped her so fondly, never kissed
her so tenderly as now when he believed that her heart ached and
her tears flowed for the sake of the mother whom he loved.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, my own sweet love, do not grieve so wildly," he said,
caressingly. "She is ill, but it may not be fatal. I broke the news
to you too suddenly. I did not realize until this moment what a
tender loving heart you have. Cheer up, darling. It may not be as
bad as we fear. We will pray for her recovery."</p>

<p>She threw back her head and looked in his face with wild dark
eyes all swimming in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, St. Leon, what did the cablegram say?" she aspirated,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"That she is very ill, dear, but that did not necessarily imply a
fatal sickness," he answered, soothingly.</p>

<p>She caught at the words with the eagerness of desperation.</p>

<p>"Oh, St. Leon, why need we go home at all then?"</p>

<p>"Beatrix!"</p>

<p>He did not know himself how coldly he put her from him, how
sharp and rebuking his tone sounded. He was hurt and amazed. It
seemed to him that he could not have understood her aright. He
looked at the beautiful form drooping before him humbly, and he
saw that he had frightened her by his sudden harshness. Her lips
were trembling with fear.</p>

<p>"Beatrix," he said, "perhaps I have not understood you aright.
Did you really express a desire not to go home?"</p>

<p>She looked at the dark, handsome face with the touch of sternness
upon it and her heart sunk within her.</p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;I thought"&mdash;she faltered, "that&mdash;if Mrs. Le Roy
were not so very ill, we need not&mdash;perhaps&mdash;go home just yet. Oh,
forgive me, St. Leon. I did not mean to be selfish. I love the Old
World so well I cannot bear the thought of going back to America!"</p>

<p>For the first time since their happy wedding-day he looked coldly
and sternly at his fair young bride. She had almost forgotten how
those proud lips could curl, how that mobile face could express the
lightning passions of his soul. She saw now what a dreadful mistake
she had made.</p>

<p>"Oh, Beatrix, how I have deceived myself!" he cried. "Do you
know what I thought just now when you burst into tears? I believed
that all your grief was for my mother, because you loved her
and were sorry for her. I never loved you so well as when I
thought that you shared so wholly in my affection for my parent.
And yet in the next breath you show me my mistake. Your pleasure,
your comfort, ranks higher in your thoughts than my mother's
welfare! Oh! child! are you, indeed, so selfish?"</p>

<p>The sadness and reproach in his voice tore her guilty heart like a
knife. She flew to his arms&mdash;she would not be held at a distance.</p>

<p>"I am a wretch!" she cried, remorsefully. "Forgive me, St.
Leon. I <i>do</i> love Mrs. Le Roy. I <i>do</i> grieve over her illness! It
was only my abominable selfishness and thoughtlessness that made
me so heartless. I have grown selfish, forgetting every one else and
finding all my happiness in you. Forget it, if you can&mdash;at least, forgive
it. I am ready to go home with you immediately. Nay, I am
most anxious to go."</p>

<p>But her voice faltered, and she shed such hot tears upon his breast
that they seemed to blister her cheeks. It seemed to her that she was
declaring her own death-warrant.</p>

<p>He could do no less than forgive her. Indeed, her sorrow and repentance
were so great that he felt that he had been too harsh and
stern with her. He remembered that she was only a child, and she
had been so pleased with her travels, it was no wonder that she had
been disappointed when the end came upon her so suddenly.</p>

<p>"Besides, I could not in reason expect her to be as fond of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
mother as I am," he said to himself, apologetically, and to ease the
smart of his disappointment.</p>

<p>He kissed the fair young face until her tears were dried, and
told her that she was forgiven for her momentary selfishness, and
that next year they would come abroad again.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we must be upon the sea. I am very anxious to
reach home," he said, little guessing that his words pierced her
heart like the point of a deadly poisoned dagger.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>All of the young bride's happiness began to wane from that hour.
The shadow of the nearing future began to fall upon her heart. The
"coming events cast their shadows before."</p>

<p>A subtle change came over her. Her cheek was a shade less
bright, her voice had an unconscious tone of pathos, the dark eyes
drooped beneath their shady lashes. Sometimes she fell into deep
reveries that lasted for hours. The return voyage was not so pleasant
by any means as the other had been. Laurel was going away
from her peril then, she was returning to it now.</p>

<p>St. Leon gave all his thoughts and all his love to his fair bride.
Now he divided them with her and his mother. He was very fond
of his handsome, stately lady mother, and deeply distressed over her
illness. He longed to fly to her on the wings of love. He chafed
over their slow progress, bitterly impatient of the adverse winds and
waves that hindered the gallant ship from making progress. If he
had known how his wife welcomed every storm he would have
been horrified. If some hidden rock had sunk the steamer, and she
and St. Leon had gone to the bottom clasped</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In one another's arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And silent in a last embrace,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she would have been glad, she would have thought that that was
happiness compared with what lay before her.</p>

<p>St. Leon did not notice the slight yet subtle change in his darling,
so absorbed was he in anxiety over his mother. Perhaps he thought
she shared in his trouble. He knew that her devotion to him was
more manifest than ever before, and he repaid it with the love of
his inmost heart, but he was very grave and thoughtful. The dread
that he might find his mother dead weighed heavily on his spirits.</p>

<p>Poor Laurel in her terror for herself did not give many thoughts
to Mrs. Le Roy. The lesser evil was swallowed up in the greater.
The Gordons had returned to New York in the spring. Once she
returned home, a meeting with them was inevitable. And then&mdash;what!
Detection, exposure, banishment, despair!</p>

<p>Through all her dread and terror one spark of hope burned feebly
in her heart. She knew that her husband loved her with a deep,
and mighty love. Perhaps through that love he would forgive her.</p>

<p>"I could forgive <i>him</i> anything," she said to herself with the divine
love of woman. "Surely, surely he will forgive me!"</p>

<p>It was May when they reached New York. Laurel had had eight
months of happiness now&mdash;almost perfect happiness. She was little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
more than a child still. She was only seventeen. But she had
gained great benefit from her happy bridal trip. Her beauty was
deepened and intensified, she had acquired polish and dignity, and
there was a sweet and gracious womanliness about her that was
exquisitely charming. St. Leon said to himself exultantly that he
should be very proud to introduce his bonny bride to New York society
next winter. She would be without a peer for loveliness.</p>

<p>"I am so impatient to go home to my sick mother at Eden, that I
am almost selfish enough to ask you to pass through New York
without stopping to see your parents," he said, when they landed.</p>

<p>She hastily assured him that she had no intention of stopping.
Her anxiety to reach Eden was as great as his own. There would
be time enough to see her parents when they were assured of Mrs.
Le Roy's well being.</p>

<p>He did not notice how deathly pale she was, but thanking her
gratefully for what appeared to him a sweet self-sacrifice, accepted
it, and she said to herself with a beating heart:</p>

<p>"I have still a little respite. I shall see Eden once more before I
am banished forever."</p>

<p>The home on the Hudson looked Eden-like indeed that bright,
warm day when they walked, arm in arm, up to the house. The
trees and shrubberies were tinted with the tender green of spring, a
soft, warm air, redolent with flowers, fanned their faces. St. Leon
looked pleased at being home again, but it struck him all at once
that his wife looked pale and wan and miserable.</p>

<p>"It is plain to be seen, Beatrix, that you have no joy in your
home-coming," he said, unable to conceal his disappointment.
"And yet I thought&mdash;indeed you used to say&mdash;that you adored
Eden."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do! I love every tree and flower, every tiniest blade of
grass on the place. I am very happy in my home-coming," she
cried, eagerly, but she had a guilty, miserable inward consciousness
that he did not believe her. Her changeful tell tale face had betrayed
her all too plainly.</p>

<p>They went into the house, and then she forgot for awhile all her
own selfish terrors as St. Leon forgot his disappointment over his
wife's reluctance to come home.</p>

<p>For the shadow of the death-angel's wing hung darkly over Eden!</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy was yet very ill with a low typhoid fever and
pneumonia. Surrounded by skillful nurses and the ablest physicians,
there were yet grave doubts whether she would ever recover.
The disease was deeply seated, and the physicians could not conceal
from the invalid's stricken son their fears of a fatal result. She had
been dangerously ill three weeks now&mdash;wavering, as it were, between
life and death. They would do all they could, the physicians
said, but the issue lay with God.</p>

<p>In that dark hour Laurel was her husband's comforter. She put
self aside. She forgot that a shadow deeper than death brooded
darkly over her own young life. She whispered peace and hope to
the troubled heart.</p>

<p>"I will pray for her," she said, "and I will nurse her. Perhaps
love can save her even where paid attention fails. Then, too, she
will be so glad to have her children home again. Happiness may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
have a good effect upon her. Do not despair, St. Leon, I have the
greatest faith that she will be spared to us."</p>

<p>His heavy heart unconsciously grew lighter at the sweet, hopeful
words. And one thing she said came true at least. Though they
were almost afraid to break the news to Mrs. Le Roy of her son's
arrival, and set about it in the most cautious manner, it undoubtedly
produced a beneficial effect on her. She seemed to grow better from
that hour, and her joy at seeing Laurel was as great as that she
evinced in the return of St. Leon.</p>

<p>Laurel, as she had declared she would, became the most devoted
and patient nurse at Mrs. Le Roy's bedside. Her love and her eagerness
to be of use served her instead of experience. There was no
step so light, no touch so cool and soft as hers, no face so eagerly
welcomed by the bedside of the sufferer.</p>

<p>"Beatrix is my ministering angel," she confided to her son, and
Laurel, hearing it, was thrilled with inward joy.</p>

<p>"I have won a place in her heart. When my dark hour comes,
she will take my part, she will plead for me," the poor child said to
herself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Gordon, reclining at ease on a satin divan in her elegant
parlor, was entertaining a caller&mdash;no less a person than the beautiful
widow, Mrs. Merivale.</p>

<p>The wife of the wealthy publisher was a pale, faded, pretty
woman, once a belle and beauty, now a chronic invalid. She mingled
but little in society, on account of her delicate health, but
chance had made her acquainted with Maud Merivale, and the fair
widow for some reason of her own had followed up the acquaintance.
Mrs. Gordon was rather pleased than otherwise with this
new friend. She loved beauty, and Mrs. Merivale was decidedly
good to look upon. All the adventitious aid of art had been called
in to preserve her fading charms; and in the richest, and most becoming
of spring toilets, she looked very fair and sweet and youthful
in the aristocratic semi-darkness of the curtained parlor.</p>

<p>They had been discussing a subject dear to Mrs. Gordon's matronly
heart, but full of secret gall and bitterness to the widow&mdash;the
marriage of Beatrix Gordon to St. Leon Le Roy.</p>

<p>Inwardly fuming with jealous rage, Mrs. Merivale held her passions
in with a strong rein, and smiled her sweetest as she dilated
on her last summer's visit to Eden where she had met Beatrix and
enthusiastically "fallen in love with her on the spot."</p>

<p>"So beautiful, so graceful," said Mrs. Merivale, arching her
penciled brows. "She will make so charming a mistress for Eden.
And they are home from Europe, you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago," answered Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>"You have seen them, of course&mdash;how happy the meeting must
have been between the long-parted mother and daughter," sentimentally.</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen my darling yet," sighed Mrs. Gordon.
"They were suddenly summoned home by the illness of Mrs. Le
Roy and did not have time to communicate with me. Mr. Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
has promised to take me down to Eden in a few days, though. I
am so impatient to see Beatrix I can scarcely wait."</p>

<p>"No doubt," smiled the visitor, sympathetically. She had followed
Mrs. Gordon's eyes to a life-size portrait of a pretty blue-eyed
girl that hung against the wall. She had seen the lady's glance
wander in the same direction several times. Her curiosity was
aroused, and, looking critically at the really beautiful portrait, she
detected a strong resemblance between the fair, fresh, girlish face
and the pretty, faded, matronly woman.</p>

<p>"Your own portrait, is it not?" she asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon looked pleased and flattered.</p>

<p>"Is it really so much like me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Your image! I should have recognized it anywhere!" pronounced
the widow, following up the good impression she had made.</p>

<p>"Well, my daughter was always said to resemble me; but really,
now, Mrs. Merivale, you must have recognized Beatrix. You flatter
me too much," simpered Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merivale's false smiles and grimaces gave way for once to an
expression of honest surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that it isn't your portrait&mdash;taken when
you were, perhaps, a little younger?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, it is not mine. Do you not recognize my daughter, Mrs.
Merivale? It is Beatrix herself."</p>

<p>"Beatrix!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Merivale gazed bewildered at the fair young pictured face.
The soft blue eyes smiled into hers, the pale-gold hair waved softly
over the low, white brow, the face had a fair, refined loveliness all
its own, but it was not the face she recalled as that of Beatrix Gordon.
There flashed before her mind's eye a face bright and soft
like a tropic flower, lighted by dark, starlike eyes, crowned by grand
tresses of dusky, burnished gold&mdash;a face before whose rare and
witching beauty this other one paled like a flower before a star.</p>

<p>She looked at Mrs. Gordon, surprise and bewilderment on her
face, her turquois-blue eyes open to their widest.</p>

<p>"Are you jesting?" she said. "Or have you another daughter?
You do not really wish me to believe that this is Beatrix?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Mrs. Gordon asked, a little gravely.</p>

<p>"It is not the least bit like her," declared Mrs. Merivale, who
had left her seat and rustled over to the portrait; "it is utterly unlike
her! The eyes are blue here, the hair pale gold; yet your
daughter whom I saw at Eden had dark eyes and hair of the darkest
golden shade."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"You have surely forgotten how Beatrix looked," she said.
"That canvas represents her truly and perfectly. The best judges
have agreed that the portrait is marvelously true to nature. My
dear Mrs. Merivale, you are thinking of some one else. I have no
other child than Beatrix, and there are no dark eyes in our family."</p>

<p>Mrs. Merivale remained silent for a moment. Her face had a
dazed expression.</p>

<p>"I am <i>not</i> mistaken," she said to herself. "Is it likely I should
forget how the girl looked who stole St. Leon from me? She had
great black eyes, full of fire and soul. She was rarely beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
This portrait looks a mere doll beside her. And yet Mrs. Gordon
swears that this is Beatrix Gordon. If it is true, as she says, then
there is some mystery about it. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>She went back to her seat again and replied to Mrs. Gordon with
a light laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see now that I was mistaken. I was thinking of some
one else. One meets so many fair faces in society."</p>

<p>But to herself she was saying:</p>

<p>"If there is a mystery, I will find it out. Nothing will please me
so well as to injure the girl who married St. Leon Le Roy."</p>

<p>But though her suspicions were aroused, they were vague and unformed.
She did not dream of the real truth.</p>

<p>Before leaving she said, with her most innocent and engaging air:</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to run down to Eden with you when you
go. It is only recently that I received a letter from Mrs. Le Roy,
inviting me to visit her. We are quite old friends, you know. Shall
you object to have me make one of your party?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon thought it would be rather pleasant than otherwise
to have the pretty, vivacious widow accompany them to Eden. She
expressed her opinion very graciously, and Mrs. Merivale was delighted.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks," she twittered. "I shall enjoy the trip
with you and Mr. Gordon so much. And I do so want to see dear
Mrs. Le Roy, and our sweet bride and her husband, who, by the
bye, was once my <i>fiancé</i>. But that was long ago. I threw him over
for Mr. Merivale, who had the most money, although, unfortunately,
he sunk a great deal in a foolish speculation after I married him.
Ah, well, St. Leon will bear me no ill will now, when he has secured
such a bonny bride."</p>

<p>She lingered until they had named the day for the trip, then departed,
full of vague plans against the happiness of St. Leon's bride.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>Ross Powell had been bitterly chagrined and disappointed at his
failure to trace Laurel Vane, after his meeting with her at the gates
of Eden.</p>

<p>Her beauty had inspired him with a passion that all her anger and
scorn and detestation were powerless to chill. While he tried to
hate her for her disdain, he could not help loving her for the rare
loveliness that had won him at first sight. Brooding deeply over the
subject after his return to New York, he made up his mind that, if
he could not possess Laurel in any other way, he would make her
his wife. He did not doubt but that she would be delighted at the
chance of becoming Mrs. Powell, and, after coming to this magnanimous
resolve, he was exceedingly anxious to find her out and
propose to her.</p>

<p>But fate was against him. His clerkly duties kept him chained
to his desk so closely that it was only at the Christmas holidays he
found an opportunity of returning to the vicinity of Eden to prosecute
his search. After long cogitation on the subject, he had concluded
that Laurel had misled him in stating that she was not staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
at Eden. He now believed that she belonged to the staff of
domestics at Eden, and that she had hidden her identity under an
assumed name.</p>

<p>"The little jade tricked me cleverly that time, but I'll catch up
with her yet!" he muttered, angrily, to himself, for he did not relish
the idea of having been duped by a simple girl like Laurel.</p>

<p>So, with his faculties sharpened by reflection, and spurred on by
his passion&mdash;which only gained in strength by the months of suspense
he had endured&mdash;Ross Powell returned to the palace on the
Hudson, where he hoped to find Laurel employed in some menial
capacity by the proud, rich Le Roys.</p>

<p>Alas for Laurel if she had remained at Eden! for the villain
would most undoubtedly have detected her this time; but, as the
reader knows, she was absent in Europe with her husband. Mr.
Powell, in a sly, underhand way, informed himself thoroughly regarding
the household at Eden, and became satisfied that the object
of his search was not there. He was bitterly enraged at his non-success
in the pursuit of the beautiful, and, as he imagined, unprotected
orphan.</p>

<p>"I was a fool to let her slip through my fingers so easily that
day," he told himself. "I wish I had followed her, and let Mr.
Gordon's business go to the mischief until I had settled my own!
A little delay would not have mattered to him, while my own cause
was ruined by my attention to business. Never mind! Once I get
on her track again, she shall not escape me! Twice she has given
me the slip. Let her look to the third time!"</p>

<p>Alas! poor Laurel, in her summer home across the sea, she had
forgotten this crafty spider that lay in wait for her, whose love was
crueler than hate.</p>

<p>He returned to the city, sullen, angry, disappointed, but more
anxious than ever to find her. A new idea had taken possession of
his mind.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that Laurel had perhaps gone abroad in the
capacity of maid to the young bride, Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p>This idea having once taken possession of his mind, was dwelt on
until it became a rooted belief. He was quite certain that he had
solved the mystery of her absence now. He cursed her for a clever
little wretch, who could never have eluded him so cleverly if she had
not inherited her father's brains.</p>

<p>"And he was a genius," he said. "Egad, it seems a little
strange that old Vane's pretty, high-bred looking girl should descend
to the level of a common servant. He was proud, although he
ruined himself by drink. I wonder if his bones don't turn in the
coffin at thought of little Laurel waiting on Beatrix Gordon!"</p>

<p>He made arrangements to be informed at the earliest hour of the
return of Mr. Le Roy and his bride to Eden. He swore that quick-witted
Laurel should not forestall him and get away this time.</p>

<p>"If she only knew that I meant to do the fair thing by her and
make her Mrs. Powell, I have no doubt she would be deuced glad
to have me find her," he thought, egotistically. "It's a bother that
I can't have her without, but she's a high-strung little filly, and has
her own notions. Perhaps I can arrange for a mock marriage.
Then, when I am tired of her, I can drop her more easily. She will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
drown herself, of course, when she finds out that she has been deceived."</p>

<p>So ran the musings of the wretch, and his impatience reached
fever-heat as the dreary winter months dragged away and still Mr.
Le Roy lingered abroad with his lovely bride, little dreaming in their
happiness of the clerk sitting behind the desk in Mr. Gordon's office
and growing ever more and more impatient for their return.</p>

<p>Winter passed away at length, followed by March with its chilling,
boisterous winds, its clouded, murky skies; April came with its
sunshine and rain, May with its balmy airs and fragrant flowers.
Still they came not. How he hated those grand, rich people who
could loiter their time away amid the beauties and luxuries of the
old world, and keep Laurel away from him, losing her heart perhaps
to some musical Italian, frog-eating Frenchman, or sturdy Englishman.
A vague, bitter jealousy of he knew not what filled his heart.</p>

<p>He never forgot how glad he felt when in the latter part of May
he heard that Mr. Le Roy and his bride had returned to Eden. A
burning impatience filled him to get away from the office and go
down to Eden to assure himself if Laurel were really there.</p>

<p>He made some excuse of indisposition or private business&mdash;in fact,
the first ready lie that came to his tongue&mdash;and asked Mr. Gordon
for a holiday; it was granted, and on the same day Ross Powell went
down to Eden, so confident of success that the disappointment he
experienced staggered him with its bitterness and intensity.</p>

<p>For when he went boldly to the servants' entrance and asked for
young Mrs. Le Roy's maid, a pert foreigner, a mademoiselle whom St.
Leon had engaged in Paris to attend his wife, came to him. Her
broken English, her voluble French, her cap and ribbon, alike disgusted
him. He crushed a bitter oath between his teeth and went
away.</p>

<p>"It is just as I feared and dreaded," he thought. "Some jackanapes
over the sea has won her, and she would not return with the
Le Roys, who had to engage that painted, beribboned, chattering
monkey in her place. I have a great mind to go and ask Mr. Gordon's
daughter to tell me about Laurel Vane."</p>

<p>But on second thoughts he concluded not to do so. It would come
to Mr. Gordon's ears and might possibly set unpleasant inquiries on
foot. After all it could not avail him anything to know how he had
lost her. Fate had played him a trick, a dastardly trick that nothing
could undo now. There was nothing to do but resign the hopes that
had buoyed him up for many months, realize that the game he had
played was over, and that he had been the loser. His love turned
to hate, his passion to a dastardly yearning for revenge upon the
beautiful, high-spirited girl.</p>

<p>"The little black-eyed jade! How cleverly she gave me the slip!
I would give anything on earth to be able to punish her," he muttered,
wickedly, to himself.</p>

<p>He was walking slowly along the dusty road that wound along
the banks of the river, and had already left the beautiful, extensive
grounds of Eden some distance behind him. The sun was setting
resplendently, gilding the beautiful river with gold, and a soft
breeze fanned his hot brow; but the beauties of nature had no
charm for his passion-seared soul. He walked on with lowering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
moody brows, and did not look up until a cloud of dust blowing
over him and the sound of approaching carriage wheels forced an
impatient imprecation to his lips. Then he looked up, and the sight
he beheld was photographed on his memory forever.</p>

<p>An exquisite little phaeton&mdash;the daintiest, the most fairy-like he
had ever beheld in his life&mdash;was approaching him, drawn by two
superb white horses, whose smooth, satiny coats, gold-mounted
harness, and azure bridle-reins glittered in the golden sunlight.
Among the blue-satin cushions sat a lady and a gentleman, the latter
a dark, handsome, prince-looking man, whom he recognized instantly
as St. Leon Le Roy. Beside him sat a young beauty, in the
daintiest Parisian bonnet and toilet, smiles on her lips, love in her
eyes, peerless loveliness on the face lifted so tenderly to St. Leon's.
Ross Powell gave one quick look into that beautiful face, and
gasped, like one dying:</p>

<p>"Laurel Vane!"</p>

<p>St. Leon saw the man trudging in the dust, and touched his hat
courteously. Laurel saw him, and her young face whitened to the
hue of death. Ross Powell did not return the gentleman's bow, did
not move nor speak; he only stood still in the road, like one dazed,
while the dazzling equipage whirled past him and covered him with
dust.</p>

<p>The echoing sound of the wheels, that seemed to roll over his
heart, died away; the dust-cloud slowly lowered and sunk to its
kindred earth again. During those moments he had stood stock-still,
like one dead, staring blindly before him. He roused himself
now, shook himself like one awakened from a painful dream, and,
turning, gazed down the road.</p>

<p>He was too late! The dainty equipage, with its daintier mistress
and handsome master, had gone out of sight like a dream. He was
alone in the golden glow of the beautiful sunset, the soft sound of
the river in his ears, his heart on fire with the memory of that lovely
face that had flashed on him suddenly like a star out of blackest
night.</p>

<p>"Laurel Vane! And by St. Leon Le Roy's side! What does it
mean?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>He went over in his mind every detail of the beautiful, happy
face, the rich dress, the shining jewels she wore. Only the richest
ladies in New York wore such things as these, he knew. Why did
Laurel Vane have them? How came she to be sitting by St. Leon
Le Roy's side&mdash;one of the proudest, richest men in the State?</p>

<p>He sat down on the grassy river bank, and tried to collect his
thoughts. He was all at sea; he could not understand.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>There was no longer any fear that Mrs. Le Roy would die. She
was better. She was rapidly convalescing.</p>

<p>St. Leon was very happy over her recovery.</p>

<p>He had not known how well he loved his mother until the dread
of her loss hung over him. He had been sad and gloomy over the
prospect of losing her. He was light-hearted and jubilant now over
her convalescence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Not the least of his happiness was that his mother, with all the
fancifulness of an invalid, ascribed her recovery to her daughter-in-law's
devoted care and nursing. She would not give any credit to
the physicians who had exhausted the skill of the Esculapian art for
her benefit. She declared that the paid nurses were a set of careless,
neglectful dolts. She was quite sure that she must have perished
among them but for the love and care of her son's wife.</p>

<p>St. Leon and his wife both knew that the invalid was unjust to
her faithful attendants, and that really they had done all they could
to hasten her recovery. But they could not help being pleased and
happy over her affectionate fiction; and, indeed, Laurel had devoted
herself, with unsparing love and patience, to St. Leon's mother.
When care and skill had failed, she had gone on her knees in
prayer, though it often crossed her mind that, perhaps, God would
not hear the pleadings of one who was herself living a dreadful lie
of which she could not repent, because she was so blissfully happy
that she could not realize the enormity of her sin.</p>

<p>But all doubt was over now. The gloomy shadow of the death-angel's
wing no longer hung over Eden. The physicians declared
that Mrs. Le Roy would live, and Mrs. Le Roy declared that her
daughter-in-law had saved her life. No one gainsaid her, for they
saw that the fancy made her happier, and St. Leon, if possible, loved
his wife more passionately than before for her devotion to his
mother.</p>

<p>When the long strain of fear and anxiety was over, they began to
see that the faithful nurse had suffered somewhat in her tireless
vigils by the couch of pain. She was thinner and paler, her eyes
looked wide and dark and somber, just as they did when, almost a
year ago, now, she had first come to Eden.</p>

<p>When St. Leon's terrible anxiety over his mother was dispelled,
he began to be alarmed over his wife. It struck him that she was
not looking well and scarcely happy.</p>

<p>"My darling, you have worn yourself out in tender cares for my
mother," he said. "I have been selfish to allow it. But I did not
think! You should have been more careful over yourself! But she
is better now, and you must relegate the cares of the sick-room to
others, while you go out with me and brighten your faded roses."</p>

<p>A strange mournful smile quivered over the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"I must not leave her yet," she said, "she would miss me so
much. She loves me."</p>

<p>He could not understand the wistful pathos that trembled in the
tone. He believed that her wearisome confinement to the sick-room
had saddened her spirits.</p>

<p>"She loves you," he cried, catching her in his arms, and kissing
the pale face until it glowed with tender blushes. "Who does not
love you, my own, my peerless Beatrix? You are the queen of love
and beauty! I worship you as the lovely incarnation of all that is
best and purest in your sex! And, deeply as I loved you before, I
shall always love you better for your devotion to my mother!"</p>

<p>"Always?" she murmured, and again it seemed to him there was
a ring of pathos that was almost pleading in the low, sweet voice.
It confirmed him in his belief that she was saddened and overwrought
by her wearisome confinement in the sick-chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Always, my darling. Can you doubt it?" he said, looking fondly
into the wistful dark eyes, as he held her in his arms.</p>

<p>"I will not doubt it. I will be happy as long as I can," she answered,
with a sort of desperation.</p>

<p>That day when they sat by Mrs. Le Roy's couch together, she began
herself to realize the change that had come over her son's wife.
She missed the roses from the delicate cheeks, the brightness from
the eyes, but most of all, the happy smile from the red lips. It even
seemed to her that they had a wistful, pathetic droop.</p>

<p>"I have been selfish over my daughter," she said, repentantly.
"She has broken herself down waiting on me. Beatrix, my darling,
can you forgive me for being such a selfish, thoughtless old
woman?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to forgive," she answered. "I have not felt
any weariness, and I have been only too happy to be with you and
to care for you."</p>

<p>"You are a dear, unselfish child," cried Mrs. Le Roy, "but I
don't intend to be so unreasonable again. You must leave me with
the nurses now that I am better, and go out with your husband riding
and driving again. I want to see the roses back in your face
and the light in your eyes. And, St. Leon, you must write to the
Gordons, and ask them to come and make us a visit."</p>

<p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake, do not ask them," Laurel cried out with
such sudden energy and passion that they were startled. Her face
was deathly white with the shock she had received. They looked
at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"My dear, I do not think you understood my mother," said her
husband. "She wishes to invite your parents to visit you. Should
you not be pleased to have them come?"</p>

<p>She saw that in her terror she had almost betrayed her horrible
fear of the Gordons.</p>

<p>"I understood," she faltered. "I only meant&mdash;meant that it
would be better not to ask them just yet, until your mother is better&mdash;until
she is able to go out some. It would be pleasanter for all,
would it not?"</p>

<p>They agreed with her that it would be pleasanter for all parties,
but they did not want to tax her patience too much. It seemed only
natural that she should be longing to see her mother.</p>

<p>"I might take you up to New York for a day or two," St. Leon
suggested.</p>

<p>And again the beautiful face grew ghastly pale with fear and
dread.</p>

<p>"No, I should not like that," she said, "I would prefer to have
them come here. But let us wait a few days before we invite
them."</p>

<p>She left them and went away to her own private room, locked the
door, and threw herself down upon her couch in a perfect passion
of dread and despair. The coils of fate were narrowing around her.
She could not escape from the web her own hands had woven. A
few hours or days at most, and then detection, shame, ignominy,
perhaps banishment. The thought quivered like a sword-point in
her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will he forgive me, or will he send me away from him?" she
asked herself, fearfully.</p>

<p>She sat up and looked with dazed, heavy eyes at the elegance and
luxury with which his love had surrounded her&mdash;at the diamonds
on her hands, at her rich and costly robes&mdash;all mute tokens of the
adoration in which he held her.</p>

<p>"He loves me so dearly, perhaps he will forgive me," she whispered
to her beating heart. "I know if he had wronged me ever so
bitterly, I should forgive him and love him still if he prayed me on
his bended knees, as I shall do."</p>

<p>She pinned all her faith to the strength of his love and the power
of that beauty on which he never wearied of gazing. She grew suddenly
alarmed at the pallor of her face and the heaviness of her
eyes. She thought that her beauty was deserting her, that potent
charm by which she hoped to hold his heart when he found her out
in her sin.</p>

<p>"I must go out, indeed," she cried to herself, in sudden terror;
"I must get back my brightness and my color. I cannot afford to
lose one charm that may hold my husband's heart!"</p>

<p>She forgot that he valued truth and honor more than mere physical
loveliness&mdash;she forgot that he had scorned all womanhood for
long years because one beautiful woman had been false to him. She
could think of nothing but her anguished yearning not to lose her
husband.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>That day on which Ross Powell saw Laurel with her husband
was the last of a series of happy walks and rides she had taken with
St. Leon.</p>

<p>On that day that closed in so softly with the goldenest sunshine
and tenderest twilight, that day seemed too fair for a day of fate,
the suspended sword fell.</p>

<p>Yet she had never felt its shadow less than she did that day. She
gave herself up blindly to her happiness, prizing it all the more because
she knew it could not last. When she went to dress for her
drive that evening she was most particular about her toilet. She
chose a Parisian robe of cream and ruby colors, that was particularly
becoming. Her bonnet was of creamy duchess lace, and its coronet
of pale-pink rosebuds rested daintily against her rich golden waves
of hair. The delicate lace at her throat was held by a gold bar set
with pink coral and diamonds. Her boots and gloves were Parisian;
her rose satin parasol shed a lovely glow over her pearl-fair complexion.</p>

<p>She was lovely as a dream, and she looked the dainty aristocrat
from head to foot. St. Leon Le Roy said to himself with pardonable
pride that he had won the most beautiful woman in the world
for his wife.</p>

<p>She had never enjoyed a ride more than she did that afternoon.
St. Leon had never been more tender and devoted. It was like
heaven to look up into those dark, speaking eyes and read the love
and adoration in his face. It filled her with a great passionate rapture
and delight. She worshiped her noble husband with the blindest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
most unreasoning passion woman's heart ever knew. In him
she "lived and moved and had her being."</p>

<p>She had forgotten for a little while the brooding shadow of the
sword that hung ever over her head. The sunshine was reflected
in her eyes, smiles were on her lips, when suddenly like a thunderbolt
falling from a clear sky, the sight of Ross Powell's face came
before her&mdash;that evil face which she both hated and dreaded, remembering
how he had sworn to be revenged on her for her just
womanly scorn.</p>

<p>In that moment the sun went out of her sky, the light went out
of her life. She stifled the wail of dismay that rose to her lips, and
sunk back among the satin cushions pale as death, her breath coming
and going in great panting gasps, a mute terror in the depths of
her wide, dark eyes.</p>

<p>He recognized her. She read that in the wonder and amaze that
flashed over his face. What would he do? she asked herself. She
almost expected to see him spring to her horses' heads, and, checking
them with a grasp of his infuriated hands, charge her then and
there with her sin.</p>

<p>He did nothing of the sort. He only stood and stared like a man
turned to stone while they whirled past him. St. Leon touched his
hat courteously, and in a moment it was all over. They had turned
a bend in the road, and the man standing there, ignobly covered with
the dust of their carriage-wheels, was out of sight.</p>

<p>St. Leon turned to his wife.</p>

<p>"It is your father's clerk&mdash;is it not?" he was saying; but he
paused, stricken dumb by the sight of her face. He was startled
and frightened. It was a moment before speech came to him. Then
he cried out, in alarm: "Beatrix, my darling, what is it? You are
as pale as a ghost. Are you ill?"</p>

<p>Her voice sounded faint and far-off, even to herself, as she answered
him.</p>

<p>"I felt a sudden pain in my heart. Do not be alarmed, St. Leon.
I shall recover in a moment."</p>

<p>He watched her anxiously, and he saw that she did not recover
herself very fast. She tried hard to shake off the terrible weight
that oppressed her heart, and to be her own natural self for the few
last moments that were all that remained to her of the happiness
that had been so perfect and so brief.</p>

<p>But she could not do it; she could not summon back the color to
her face, the smiles to her lips, the brightness to her eyes. She could
not still the wild, terrified beating of her heart. She felt a terrible
choking sensation, like one dying. When she spoke, her voice had
a strange sound even to herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy was frightened over his darling. He did not think of
connecting her sudden seizure with the appearance of Ross Powell.
He had forgotten the man's very existence in his anxiety.</p>

<p>When they reached home he almost carried her into the house in
his arms. He brought wine to her with his own hands. It was
only when he saw that it had revived her and made her better, that
he left her to the care of the little be-ribboned French maid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Mlle. Marie hovered around her mistress with many delicate
attentions after her master had departed, but her ministrations were
not crowned with much success. Laurel lay still and pale, but consumed
by an agony of impatience, under the dabs of <i>eau de Cologne</i>
that the maid bestowed on her cheeks and forehead. She longed to
be alone to weep and wail aloud in her despair, but she could not
send the maid away. She knew that she had to dress for dinner in
a little while, and as Mrs. Le Roy would be down to dinner for the
first time that day, her absence would be felt as a great disappointment.
She would not give up. She would keep up the farce to
the last moment.</p>

<p>She lay there, outwardly still and calm, but consumed by a burning
suspense and unrest, her hearing strained to its utmost, as if
waiting to hear her accuser's voice. She wondered if Ross Powell
would follow her, and denounce her. Surely he knew her secret
now. She could hide it from him no longer. In a little while he
must know all.</p>

<p>Once, a wild impulse of flight came over her. How could she
stay and meet her husband's scorn when he learned the truth? He
worshiped her now as his ideal of womanhood. What would he say
when he knew her as she was, weak and willful, a girl who had
risked everything for the sake of love? Would he hate her for her
sin? That would be more bitter than death. Perhaps it were better
to go away now before he knew her at her worst, before he hated
her for deceiving him.</p>

<p>If she had guessed what lay before her, she would have gone&mdash;she
would have fled silently from Eden, bearing with her for the light of
her darkened future the memory of his love alone&mdash;his smiles, his
caresses, his tender words&mdash;but the madness of her love made her
stay.</p>

<p>"I cannot go. All is not lost yet," she said, faintly, yet hopefully,
to her foreboding heart. "He will forgive me, perhaps, for our
love's sake."</p>

<p>She knew that there could be no limit to her love and forgiveness
for her husband if he had wronged her. Was it strange that she
should judge him by herself? She was very young and very ignorant.
She did not know how truthfully the poet had written:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis woman's whole existence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she was dressed for dinner, St. Leon came to take her
down. There was a subdued happiness and excitement shining on
his handsome face; she wondered at it, but she did not ask him why.</p>

<p>She was dressed much as she had been on the night when he first
told her that he loved her. She wore white, with scarlet, jacqueminot
roses. She had chosen the costume purposely, thinking he
would be softened at the memories it recalled.</p>

<p>He took his fair young wife into his arms, and kissed her many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
times; he smoothed the waving, golden tresses with loving hands,
telling her how dearly he loved her&mdash;how happy she made him.
Then, even while she clung to him, he released her gently from his
embrace, not knowing it was the last&mdash;not dreaming of the years to
come, when his arms would ache in vain to clasp her.</p>

<p>"My mother is waiting for you in the drawing-room," he said.
"There is some one with her&mdash;a visitor. Can you guess whom,
darling?"</p>

<p>She gave a terrible start&mdash;a smothered cry&mdash;and clung to his arm
with both small, white hands.</p>

<p>"My dear, how nervous you are!" he said. "One would think
you were frightened. It is your old rival, Maud Merivale. Think
of her insufferable impertinence in coming here after that night last
summer! But courage, love, she will only be consumed with envy
when she sees how much lovelier you have grown since you became
my wife."</p>

<p>She tried to murmur some careless reply, but her heart leaped
with fear. Another enemy! Too surely the coils of fate were closing
round her!</p>

<p>They went down the broad staircase, along the lighted hall, and
so into the brilliant drawing-room, the handsome man with the
lovely girl borne proudly on his arm. She looked up and saw Mrs.
Le Roy smiling at her, Mrs. Merivale rustling toward her in "gloss
of satin and glimmer of pearls," and, beyond her, two others&mdash;a
man and a woman&mdash;both strangers. They were rising eagerly, too,
coming toward her with smiles and outstretched hands. A dim perception
flashed over Laurel; her heart felt like a stone in her breast.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>It was a supreme moment. Laurel felt it to be such. Her heart
beat, her limbs trembled beneath her. But for the support of St.
Leon's arm she must have fallen to the earth. She wondered that
she did not faint&mdash;rather that she did not die&mdash;for an intuition, swift
as the lightning's flash, told her that these two strangers were Mr.
Gordon and his wife.</p>

<p>She had never seen them in her life; but she did not for one moment
doubt their identity. She saw Mrs. Merivale modestly giving
place to them, allowing them to greet her first; she saw the smile of
pleasure on St. Leon's lips&mdash;St. Leon, who thought she was having
such a pleasant surprise. She could not move nor speak. She
clung desperately to St. Leon's arm, and they came nearer and
nearer, the tall, rather stern-looking man, and the pretty, faded
blonde in her rich silks and laces. Laurel gazed at them with her
great, dark, frightened eyes, much as the little princes in the Tower
might have gazed upon their murderers.</p>

<p>A great horror grew upon her as if, indeed, they were about to
strike her dead. She had been caught in a horrible trap&mdash;a pit of
destruction yawned beneath her feet&mdash;in a moment she would be
hurled down, down, down, into fathomless darkness and despair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon drew nearer and nearer. There was a tender smile
on the fair, delicate face, and the blue eyes looked straight into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Laurel's own for an instant&mdash;only an instant, for then she started
backward, and her cry of dismay and wonder pealed on the impostor's
ears like the knell of doom.</p>

<p>"Beatrix! Oh, my God, it is not Beatrix! What does this
mean?"</p>

<p>"It is not Beatrix!" Mr. Gordon echoed, blankly.</p>

<p>And for a moment there reigned a terrible silence in the room.</p>

<p>St. Leon Le Roy looked down at his wife. She was clinging to
his arm with the desperation of despair. Her face was pale as
death, and convulsed with fear. Her wide, frightened, dark eyes
stared up straight into his, with a hunted look in their somber depth
that pierced his heart.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, what do they mean?" he cried. "Have they all gone
mad?"</p>

<p>Her white lips tried to syllable the word "mad," but it died upon
them in a straining gasp.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon came slowly forward, a dazed expression on his features.</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Roy, there must be some mistake," he said. "This
lady is not your wife?"</p>

<p>St. Leon answered gravely:</p>

<p>"There is no mistake. This is my wife, Mr. Gordon."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon cried out, startlingly:</p>

<p>"Then where is our daughter?"</p>

<p>She looked ready to faint. Her limbs tottered beneath her. She
clung to her husband with one hand pressed upon her throbbing
heart, and stared at the lovely creature on St. Leon's arm as if she
were a ghost. Mrs. Le Roy, still pale and wan from her recent illness,
rose from the couch where she reclined and tottered to her side.</p>

<p>"My dear friends, have you all taken leave of your senses?" she
cried. "Have you forgotten your own daughter's face? Beatrix,
darling, why do you not come to your mother?"</p>

<p>Only a stifled moan came from Laurel's lips, but Mrs. Gordon answered,
sternly:</p>

<p>"This is no daughter of ours. We have never seen her face before
to-night!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Merivale, in the background, gazed in gloating wonder
and triumph at the pale, horrified face of St. Leon's wife. She was
burning with anxiety to hear the <i>dénouement</i> of this strange and
startling scene.</p>

<p>"This is no daughter of ours. We have never seen her face before
to-night," repeated Mr. Gordon, and his wife feebly reiterated
his words.</p>

<p>"You have gone mad&mdash;both of you," Mrs. Le Roy cried out,
fretfully. "This is your daughter whom you sent to us, and whom
my son married. How dare you deny it? Speak to them, St. Leon&mdash;speak
to them, Beatrix. Do not let them deny you! It is monstrous,
it is terrible!"</p>

<p>"She is no child of ours. She will not claim to be. She is a
miserable impostor. Look at her guilty face," said Mr. Gordon,
pointing a scornful finger at the white face that did indeed look
shame-stricken and full of guilty woe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Leon had never taken his eyes from that beautiful, terrified
face. He spoke to her now, and his voice sounded hollow and stern.</p>

<p>"Beatrix, what do they mean? Is it true that you are not Mr.
Gordon's daughter?"</p>

<p>The white hands slipped from his arm, and she fell on her knees
before him, lifting up her woful white face pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, St. Leon, pity and forgive me," she moaned, appealingly.
"It is true, and I have bitterly deceived you. I am not Beatrix Gordon!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p>A silence like death fell for a moment on the group that closed
around that pathetic kneeling figure with its white uplifted face and
streaming golden hair. St. Leon's voice broke it first&mdash;hoarse and
terribly stern:</p>

<p>"If you are not Beatrix Gordon, for God's sake tell us <i>who</i> you
are?"</p>

<p>And she answered in a voice shaken by blended triumph and despair:</p>

<p>"I am your wife, St. Leon. Do not forget that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon, springing forward, shook her wildly by the arm.</p>

<p>"Look at me, girl," she cried. "What have you done with my
daughter, my blue-eyed Beatrix? Why are you here in her place?"</p>

<p>The great dark eyes, heavy with despair, turned slowly on her
face.</p>

<p>"You are her mother?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am her mother," Mrs. Gordon answered, impatiently.
"Tell me, girl, what have you done with my darling?"</p>

<p>And Laurel answered in a tone of the most pathetic wonder and
reproach:</p>

<p>"You are her mother, and yet you did not love her enough to
make her happy. You forget that 'love is lord of all.' Oh, why
did not you let her be happy in her own fashion? Then all this need
not have happened!"</p>

<p>"You drive me mad with your strange answers," wailed Mrs.
Gordon. "Will no one make her speak and tell me my child's fate?"</p>

<p>She looked around helplessly into their wondering faces. St.
Leon stood white and moveless as a marble statue, his arms folded
tightly over his broad breast, his pale brow beaded with chilly drops
of sweat, his eyes never turning from that kneeling figure. Mrs. Le
Roy, overcome with agitation, had sunk upon her sofa gasping for
breath. Maud Merivale gazed on the scene with a face of evil joy,
and Mr. Gordon looked dazed, like one staggering under a horrible
burden, but at his wife's piteous appeal he went slowly forward,
and touched the arm of the convicted impostor.</p>

<p>"You hear," he said, "you are driving us mad with your evasions!
Where is my daughter? Is she dead?"</p>

<p>A shudder ran through them all at that ominous word, but Laurel
sprung to her feet suddenly, and faced him with an almost defiant
gleam in her eyes. A dull red glow flared into her cheeks, and she
drew her graceful figure haughtily erect as she extended one slender
hand at the agitated speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think that I have murdered her that you look at me so
fiercely?" she cried. "Do you think I would harm one hair of her
lovely golden head&mdash;she who was so kind to me in my desolation
and despair? No, no, she is not dead, your daughter whom you
tried to separate from her own true lover. She is well and happy.
She is married to Cyril Wentworth, and gone abroad with him!"</p>

<p>"Married!" almost shrieked Mrs. Gordon, and her husband
echoed, blankly, "Married!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is married," Laurel answered, almost triumphantly.
"She took her fate into her own hands, and sought happiness with
her lover."</p>

<p>"Married to Cyril Wentworth! How dared she? how dared she?"
Mrs. Gordon wailed aloud, in frantic anger.</p>

<p>And Laurel looking at her gravely, answered with unconscious
pathos:</p>

<p>"Women dare everything for love's sake, you know, Mrs. Gordon."</p>

<p>The chagrined, disappointed mother broke into low, hysterical
sobs and tears. Mr. Gordon drew her gently to his side, and turned
his cold, stern gaze upon Laurel.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;how came you here in Beatrix's place?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She sent me here," Laurel answered. "She had been kind to
me, and I paid my debt of gratitude by taking her place here while
she went away and married Mr. Wentworth."</p>

<p>She felt their eyes burning upon her as she spoke. She knew that
they hated her for what she had done. She felt a dim, passing
wonder how she could stand there and bear it. She wondered that
she did not scream out aloud or fall down dead at their feet. But a
strange mechanical calmness upheld her through it all.</p>

<p>"This is the strangest story I ever heard," said Mr. Gordon.
"Can it be that Beatrix lent herself to such a plot? Tell me all about
it."</p>

<p>"There is almost nothing to tell beyond what I have told you,"
she said. "She despaired of ever winning your consent to her marriage,
and she could not give up her lover. So she sent me here with
Clarice to act a part, while she married her lover! Then they kept
it secret while they waited for Mr. Wentworth's promised European
appointment. When he received it, she went abroad with him. I
saw her myself in London. She is perfectly happy, only for her
longing to be forgiven by her parents."</p>

<p>"I will never forgive her&mdash;the false, deceitful jade!" he uttered,
fiercely.</p>

<p>She turned to him pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Do not be hard upon your beautiful daughter," she prayed.
"She loved him so dearly, she could not live without him. Oh,
you must forgive her!"</p>

<p>"Never, never!" Mrs. Gordon sobbed, bitterly.</p>

<p>Vain, proud, ambitious woman as she was, her heart was almost
broken by this terrible shock.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon's voice broke scornfully upon Laurel's tumultuous
thoughts.</p>

<p>"And this dutiful daughter of mine, did she add to her iniquities
by arranging a marriage for you? Did she teach you to deceive this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
honorable gentleman and trap him into a marriage with a wretched
impostor?"</p>

<p>The harsh words struck her like the stinging cut of a lash. She
shivered and dropped her eyes, but she did not flinch from answering
him. A marvelous bravery upheld her while she confessed her
fault and exonerated Beatrix.</p>

<p>"Mine is the fault," she said. "If your daughter had suspected
the madness that filled me, she would have betrayed me&mdash;she would
never have tolerated it for one hour. She wished me to go abroad
with her; she did not dream of the truth. But I&mdash;I sent Clarice
back to her, and I stayed on at Eden. The fault is mine; the consequences,"
her voice faltered almost to a moan, "be upon my own
head."</p>

<p>St. Leon had never yet spoken a word. Pale, statue-like, he
stood, his hearing strained to catch every word that fell from the lips
of his wife&mdash;his wife, whom he had believed to be an angel, but
whom he now knew as a false and reckless woman who had stolen
into his home and heart under a lying guise.</p>

<p>"And you," said Mr. Gordon, sternly&mdash;"who are you that have
dared do this terrible wrong? What is your name? Whence came
you?"</p>

<p>She turned suddenly and lifted her dark, anguished eyes to her
husband's face in mute wonder and entreaty. In its lightning scorn,
its terrible indignation, she read her doom. With a moan of despair
she let the long, dark lashes fall until they shaded her burning
cheeks and answered Mr. Gordon:</p>

<p>"Do not ask me my name nor my history. What can it matter
to you who hate me? My heart is broken. Let me shroud myself in
merciful mystery."</p>

<p>"You refuse to disclose your identity?" said Mr. Gordon, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I refuse," she answered, with a reckless defiance born of despair.</p>

<p>And at that moment a mocking laugh, cruel as a fiend's, rang
startlingly through the splendid room.</p>

<p>Every eye turned toward the sound. Through the wide lace curtains
that shaded the low French windows a man stepped into the
room&mdash;Ross Powell!</p>

<p>Laurel saw him, and a shriek of despair rose from her lips at the
sight of her enemy's evil, triumphant face. She covered her face
with her trembling hands and sunk down upon the floor, crouching
like a guilty creature from the angry judges surrounding her.</p>

<p>Ross Powell went forward to his employer, Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, respectfully, "you wish to know the name of
this matchless hypocrite and deceiver. I can soon enlighten you."</p>

<p>"Speak, then," Mr. Gordon answered, quickly, gazing at his
clerk in surprise and wonder.</p>

<p>"You remember Vane, the drunken writer, who died almost a year
ago?" said Ross Powell brutally.</p>

<p>"Yes; but what has Louis Vane to do with this mysterious girl?"
inquired Mr. Gordon, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Everything," answered the villain, sarcastically, "for this fine
lady&mdash;the mistress of Eden&mdash;is old Vane's daughter!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Mr. Gordon, astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes," triumphantly. "Her name is Laurel Vane, and she belonged
to me. She was promised to me, but when her tippling father
drank himself to death, she ran away, and, though I have been
on her track ever since, I could never find her until to-night. And
no wonder; for, with her humble antecedents, I never dreamed of
looking for my runaway sweetheart in the wife of the aristocratic
Mr. Le Roy!"</p>

<p>Slow, cold, stinging, every word fell on Laurel's heart like a drop
of ice. She sprung to her feet and faced him, her dark eyes blazing
with scorn and wrath.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Laurel Vane. That is true," she cried; "but every
other word you have uttered, Ross Powell, is a base and cruel lie! I
never belonged to you; I have never seen you but once or twice in
my life, and then I feared and hated you as one hates the slimy,
crawling serpent! I have never belonged to any man but Mr. Le
Roy."</p>

<p>"After the terrible way in which you have deceived Mr. Le Roy,
you will not find him willing to believe your later assertions,"
sneered the wretch.</p>

<p>The wretched young creature turned again and looked at her husband,
but he still preserved his quiet, statue-like position, his arms
folded over, his lips set in a thin, hard line, his eyes blazing with a
gloomy, lurid fire beneath the broad, massive brow that was beaded
with great, chilly drops of dew. It was the darkest hour of his life.
His humiliation was almost greater than he could bear. There was
no tenderness, no pity in his somber gaze as it met the wild, appealing
eyes of the girl who had deceived him.</p>

<p>But she went to him, she stood humbly and suppliantly before
him, her face lighted with passionate love and appeal, upheld by
the strength of her girlish will, longing to be forgiven for her sin
and taken to his heart again.</p>

<p>"St. Leon, he speaks falsely," she said. "I never belonged to
him. I never saw him until after my father's death, and then he
basely insulted my helplessness and poverty. In my anger I struck
him in the face, and he swore revenge for the blow. You see how
he takes it in vilifying my name. Do not listen to him, my husband.
I have never loved but you, never belonged to any one but
you. I deceived you in the one thing only. Will you not believe
me?"</p>

<p>His stern lips parted to answer her, but Maud Merivale rushed forward
and shook him violently by the arm.</p>

<p>"St. Leon, look to your mother," she cried. "She has fainted."</p>

<p>He turned and looked, and saw that it was true. Without a word
to Laurel he rushed to her aid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merivale caught the unhappy wife rudely by the arm; she
looked down into the dark, anguished eyes, and laughed low and
mockingly.</p>

<p>"You see how he scorns you," she said, in tones of bitter
triumph. "Your reign is over, impostor! Your sin has found you
out. He will drive you away in loathing and contempt. Ah, I am
revenged now before I even lifted a finger to punish you. Did I not
warn you&mdash;'who breaks&mdash;pays'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Laurel had no words to answer her. Her brave heart had failed
her. She slipped from her enemy's vindictive grasp and fell like a
log heavily to the floor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon lifted his mother's senseless form, and bore her away to
her room. Mrs. Gordon lay weeping, moaning, and wildly lamenting
in her husband's arms. Ross Powell, having accomplished his
wicked work, and finding himself unnoticed, stole quietly away from
the scene of his villainy. No one seemed to heed the prostrate form,
lying prone upon the floor like one dead, the marble-white face, with
its closed eyes and night-black lashes, upturned to the light&mdash;no one
save Mrs. Merivale, and she actually spurned it with her dainty foot,
and glared upon it with envenomed hatred in her turquois-blue eyes.</p>

<p>"The little viper!" she muttered, bitterly. "Oh, that I had
known the truth when I was here last summer! How I should have
exulted in betraying her to my haughty lord who laughed at my
love, and scorned me because once I was false to the trust he placed
in me! She was an angel forsooth. Ha! ha! I would not have
missed this rich scene for ten thousand dollars. What has become
of that man who came so opportunely upon the scene? I must see
him. It may be worth my while."</p>

<p>She cast a glance of hate and scorn upon Laurel's silent, recumbent
figure, then hastened to the window and glided out, the heavy
curtains of silk and lace falling noiselessly together behind her retreating
form. The great gilded drawing-room, with its brilliant
chandeliers and myriad flowers, was deserted now save for the half
frantic Gordons and the unconscious girl upon the floor.</p>

<p>Unnoticed and deserted she struggled back to life and found herself
alone save for those two who gazed upon her with reproach and
hatred as the cause of their desolation. She had lent herself to the
plot to rob them of their daughter, and they could not forgive her
any more than they could forgive Beatrix for her unfilial desertion.</p>

<p>But she went and stood before them, so beautiful in her sorrow
and despair, with her disheveled golden tresses and the red roses
dying on her breast, that they could almost have pitied her in her
tender youth and grief, if only she had not helped Beatrix to her
happiness, and spoiled their clever scheme for separating her from
her handsome, penniless lover.</p>

<p>"I have wronged you," she said, sadly. "I know that. But,
believe me, I could not help it. She&mdash;your daughter&mdash;had been kind
to me, and I promised her my eternal gratitude. When she claimed
my promise, what could I do but yield! And&mdash;and&mdash;she is very
happy. You must not forget that when you think of her. Perhaps
you may forgive me when you know that she is so perfectly happy."</p>

<p>"Forgive!" they uttered, scornfully, for the thought that Beatrix
was happy in her stolen marriage was like a thorn in the flesh to
them. They felt hard and vindictive toward their beautiful, willful
child. They would have been glad to hear that she was ill, unhappy,
repentant, starving, even&mdash;anything but happy.</p>

<p>"You will forgive me, and forgive her?" pleaded the hapless
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never!" they answered, harshly, hardening their hearts against
the two young creatures who had carried out that daring conspiracy.</p>

<p>And Laurel began to realize the enormity of what she had done.
It had not seemed so bad to her at first, this helping a fair young girl
and her lover to be happy in spite of opposition. She remembered
that Clarice had called it a splendid joke, and Beatrix had laughed
at her scruples. But it was quite another thing to the Gordons. It
was a cruel outrage, and beyond pardon.</p>

<p>She stood looking at their cold, frowning faces a moment, then
turned hopelessly away. Every one was against her. If only St.
Leon would forgive her she would not care for the rest, she thought;
but, alas&mdash;</p>

<p>"His love is turned to hate," she sighed. "He will never forgive
me. He will drive me away from him into eternal banishment.
My brief dream of happiness is over. And yet I was mad enough
to think that out of his great love he would forgive me! Ah, me!
ah, me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon led his wife silently from the room without a glance
at her. She was alone in the great, gilded drawing-room&mdash;deserted
and alone in her terrible anguish and despair. The sting of their
contempt pierced her heart.</p>

<p>"I am despised and deserted by all," she said, sorrowfully.
"What shall I do? Must I go away? Would St. Leon like it?
Would he be glad never to see me again?"</p>

<p>Something like a wail of anguish came from her lips at the thought
of leaving her husband and never seeing him again. It was more
bitter than death. She thought of his passionate, idolizing love.
Had it all been murdered at one fell stroke by the knowledge of her
sin?</p>

<p>The door opened, and he came suddenly into the room.</p>

<p>He saw her standing there, the only creature in the wide, brilliant
drawing-room. He knew that every one had deserted her for
her sin&mdash;that fatal retribution had overtaken her. His own heart
had revolted from its allegiance, now that he knew her for the willful
creature of clay that she was instead of the angel he had deemed
her. Yet never had her perfect beauty struck him more forcibly
than now. Robbed of its light, its coloring, its bloom, its perfection
still showed supreme, like the beauty of a perfectly chiseled statue.</p>

<p>She ran to him; she threw herself humbly at his feet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There, with her milk-white arms and shadowy hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She made her face a darkness."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Forgive me, my husband, forgive me!" prayed the wretched
wife.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<p>He stood there in silence, looking down at that bowed head,
veiled by its sweeping golden hair. He made no effort to raise her;
he answered not a word to her wild appeal. There was a smoldering
fire in his dark eyes, a stern compression of his lips, that boded
ill for the granting of her prayer.</p>

<p>He had received a terrible shock. His love and his pride alike had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
been outraged, and in his case it was a strong love and a strong
pride. The wound to both was accordingly all the greater.</p>

<p>His strange silence grew terrible to her. She lifted her face a little
and looked at him, recoiling from the terrible indignation in his
eyes as if he had struck her a blow.</p>

<p>"St. Leon, speak to me," she wailed. "Oh, you will not be hard
and unforgiving to me! I have wronged you and deceived you, I
know; but it was all because I loved you. No woman ever loved
with so mad a love as I have given you. If I had not loved you so
dearly, I had not dared so much."</p>

<p>He spoke then. There was concentrated passion, burning contempt,
in his deep and angry voice.</p>

<p>"Do not speak of love!" he said. "I can fancy with what love
the drunken journalist's daughter, the poor clerk's runaway <i>fiancé</i>,
could love St. Leon Le Roy. I can imagine that the temptation to
lift yourself to my level from the dust where you groveled was too
strong for you. I can fancy that the greed for wealth and honor led
you astray. But love&mdash;faugh! If one spark of that divine passion
had burned in your scheming breast, you would have respected the
unsullied honor, the proud old name of the Le Roys&mdash;you would
have spared me the disgraceful alliance with a drunkard's daughter!"</p>

<p>Slow, cruel, bitter, every word fell like a coal of fire on her bleeding
heart. Was it the gifted father, the brilliant genius whom she
had loved and revered despite his weakness, who was thus stigmatized
as a drunkard by her husband's lips? Had that father's
sin indeed set her apart as a mark for the finger of scorn to point at,
a creature too low to even lift her eyes to the proud and rich St. Leon
Le Roy? It was a cruel, a bitter insult. It rankled like a sword
point in her heart.</p>

<p>She rose slowly to her feet and faced him with a strange, new-born
dignity that sat gracefully on her perfect beauty. She did not
speak, but waited with drooping head and tightly folded hands for
his further words.</p>

<p>They came, still further blighting the sad young heart:</p>

<p>"There can be no talk of forgiveness between you and me. You
have injured me beyond reparation. You can be nothing to me
henceforth."</p>

<p>"You will send me away from you&mdash;you will divorce me?" she
asked, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"No, I will have no scandal. I will not drag the proud name of
Le Roy through the mire of a divorce court. That for which you
schemed so craftily shall not be taken away from you. I shall go
away and leave you at Eden in the enjoyment of the wealth and the
name you have won. Then our tacit separation and divorce will be
accomplished. I shall never willingly look upon your beautiful,
false face again!"</p>

<p>She bowed her head in speechless acquiescence. Where were the
wild words, the matchless eloquence with which she meant to plead
her cause, to implore for pardon when this dark hour came upon
her? That love and beauty which she had deemed such powerful
agents to hold his heart and win his clemency, of what avail were
they now? His icy scorn, his proud, decisive, determination left no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
room for dissent or appeal. The terrible weight of her sin had
fallen upon her and crushed her.</p>

<p>"I think you understand me," he said. "The wife I loved is
as one dead to me. She never existed save in my imagination. You
must accept this as your punishment, if indeed you can feel any remorse
for your falsehood and deceit. Now go to your room and let
your maid attend you there. I presume you will not care to meet
our guests again. I am quite sure they will not wish to see you.
Remain in seclusion. To-morrow I will make all needful arrangements
for our separation, and they shall be duly communicated to
you."</p>

<p>She lifted her head and gave one long, grave look from her heavy,
somber eyes at the handsome, haughty face, bowed slowly, and went
out of the room. The slow swish of her trailing satin robe echoed
drearily in his hearing as he stood there pale and statue-like, but he
did not turn his head for one farewell glance at the girl who was his
wife and who had so terribly deceived him.</p>

<p>She went to her room and sunk down wearily upon her sofa.
Marie the maid came in presently. Her face showed that she knew
all.</p>

<p>"Marie," she said, "go and ask Mrs. Le Roy if she will permit
me to come to her for a few moments."</p>

<p>The maid returned in a moment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Roy is with his mother. He desires that you will not
disturb her," she said.</p>

<p>Laurel answered quietly.</p>

<p>"You may go away, and leave me now, Marie, I wish to be alone
for awhile."</p>

<p>When the maid had gone she went to the window, drew back the
rich curtains of silk and lace and gazed out upon the scene. Night
had fallen&mdash;the beautiful moonlit summer night. The perfume of
roses and honeysuckles came floating heavily on the soft air, the
wide expanse of the Hudson shone like a silver sea.</p>

<p>"I must go away from Eden," said the girl-wife to herself,
drearily. "What shall I do with my empty, ruined life?"</p>

<p>Strangely enough there came to her a memory of the day she had
first met St. Leon Le Roy&mdash;the questions she had asked him and his
strange reply:</p>

<p>"I believe I should throw myself into yonder beautiful river and
so end all," he had said.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>


<p>Mlle. Marie was very glad to get away from attendance on her
mistress for a few hours. There is nothing happens in the parlor,
but is immediately communicated to the kitchen, so the <i>dénouement</i>
in high life had immediately become the sensation in low life below
stairs. The maid was eager to join the gossips.</p>

<p>So Laurel remained alone and undisturbed in the elegant rooms,
where she had spent such happy hours with the husband who now
disowned and abandoned her. She stared out into the beautiful
summer night with dark, inscrutable eyes, trying dimly to pierce
the veil that hid the future from her aching sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Leon Le Roy remained in attendance on his mother. The
poor lady, in her weak, enfeebled state, had sustained a terrible
shock. She had fallen from one fainting spell to another, and the
nurse and her son remained constantly by her side. At length she
recovered her reason, and was given a composing draught. She fell
into a light slumber, and St. Leon stole away and consummated that
fatal interview with his wife, then returned to watch by the invalid's
couch.</p>

<p>He did not intend to deny his wife an interview with his mother,
though he did not think it would avail her anything, believing that
she would take sides with himself against the wife who had so bitterly
deceived him. He did not think it prudent to allow a meeting
between them that night, so when Marie came he returned the curt
message that swept the last hope from Laurel's heart, and, as it
seemed, the last plank from between her and despair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy slumbered fitfully until midnight. St. Leon sent
the nurse to the lounge in the dressing-room, and kept vigil himself
by the sick-bed, looking more like a statue than a man, as he sat
there in the shaded night-light, pale and moveless, as if carved in
marble; his lips compressed sternly, a smoldering fire burning in his
veiled, dark eyes. His mind was busy with thought and memory.
He was going over, step by step, his acquaintance with the false
Beatrix Gordon from the day when she had first stood, shy and
frightened in the doorway of Eden, until to-night. He held the key
now to many a subtle enigma that had puzzled him in those past
days.</p>

<p>"So fair, so young, and seemingly so ignorant of the world, and
yet so false," he said to himself. "False to her lover, Ross Powell,
first, then doubly false in wedding me in borrowed plumes. There is
no faith nor truth in woman. They are bad and mercenary to the
core&mdash;all of them, except my honored mother. Yet my wife has the
face of an angel. Who would have believed that the greed of gold
could have tempted her to such a sin!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy stirred and opened her eyes. They rested wistfully
on the stern, impassive face of her son.</p>

<p>"Your wife, St. Leon," she said, faintly. "Have you forgiven
her?"</p>

<p>"Could there be any forgiveness for such falsity as hers, mother?"
he asked, turning sternly toward her.</p>

<p>A sigh breathed over Mrs. Le Roy's lips.</p>

<p>"She was such a child," she said, plaintively, almost excusingly.
"Have you given her any chance to exculpate herself, my son?"</p>

<p>"Could any exculpation be acceptable?" he asked again, sternly.</p>

<p>"Where is she? What has been done to her?" she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>He told her his decision, told her all that he had said to his wife
in his outraged pride and wrath. She was weeping bitterly when
he had finished.</p>

<p>"Mother, surely you do not blame me and excuse her," he said,
wonderingly. "I had no thought but that you would take my part
against her."</p>

<p>"I must see her first," she said, almost angrily in her deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
earnestness. "I cannot condemn her unheard. You will let me see
the child, St. Leon?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he answered, impatiently. "You do not suppose I
would deny any wish of that kind you choose to express, mother.
But to-night you are too ill and nervous. You will wait until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, my son, do not be angry with me&mdash;I cannot wait. Send
her to me now," she wept.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure you had better wait until to-morrow," he began,
but at that moment Mlle. Marie pushed open the door and
looked in with a pale, frightened face.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Le Roy here?" she asked. "Because she is not in her
room, and I cannot find her anywhere."</p>

<p>"St. Leon, you have driven her away," his mother cried out,
wildly.</p>

<p>He sprung to his feet in dismay.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, quickly. "Do not think such a thing, mother.
Stay here, Marie, I will go and find her if she can be found.
She is not far, of course."</p>

<p>But all the same a hand of ice seemed to grip his heart as he hurried
from the room.</p>

<p>She was gone&mdash;the dark-eyed bride whom he had loved so well,
and who had so fatally deceived him. While Marie gossiped with
her familiars she had quietly stolen away. A little, tear-blotted note
lay on her dressing-table.</p>

<p>"I have gone away, my husband," it said. "I shall never
trouble your peace again. Perhaps when I am dead you will forgive
me for having loved you, 'not wisely, but too well.'"</p>

<p>And to the pathetic note she had simply signed the despised name
of "Laurel Vane."</p>

<p>The white satin dress, the withered crimson roses, lay on the
dressing-room floor; the jewels she had worn, some costly sparkling
rubies, on her dressing-table, beside the little note. A simple walking-dress
and close hat and veil were gone from her wardrobe; but
the next morning the dark-blue veil and a pair of pretty dark kid
gloves, with the dimpled impress of her hand still in them, were
found upon the river bank close to the greedy gurgling waves. They
suggested a horrible possibility to every one.</p>

<p>And one week later a mutilated unrecognizable body was washed
upon the shore near Eden. The face was defaced beyond recognition;
but the golden hair, the dark dress, the dainty linen, were like
Laurel's. No one doubted that the despairing wife had sought
oblivion from her woes in the deep, swirling river. If St. Leon forgave
her now for her sin, he made no sign. He remained silent,
grave, inscrutable. But the waif from the river was buried quietly
in the Le Roy vault, with all the honors due to his wife. He shed
no tears, he spoke no word of the feelings that held sway within
him. The separation of death was no wider than he had meant
should exist in life.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Le Roy was inconsolable. She wept bitterly for the
daughter-in-law who had so deceived her. She forgave her for her
sin, because she was so young and had loved St. Leon so dearly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
And there was another reason, which one day, through her bitter
lamentations, she revealed to St. Leon.</p>

<p>"You must have forgiven her if you had known it, St. Leon,"
she said. "But she was so shy and she had only known it a little
while herself. She told me first, and I was so happy over the news!
There was soon to be a little heir to Eden."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>


<p>Laurel had left her veil and gloves on the bank of the river with
a deliberate purpose.</p>

<p>She desired that her angry, unforgiving husband should believe
that she was dead. Since he had deliberately planned to put her out
of his life forever, he would, no doubt, be glad to think that she
was dead. So, with a heart full of bitterness and wounded love,
she had penned that pathetic note to him and gone away.</p>

<p>All her trembling hopes were over now. She knew the worst.
St. Leon would never forgive her for the deceit by which she had
made herself his wife. He had forgotten his love; indeed, she did
not doubt but that he hated her now, and believed Ross Powell's
shameless lie against her. Mrs. Le Roy, too, had declined to see
her. Of course she took sides with her son. The poor child had
not one friend to turn to in her despair.</p>

<p>Her heart beat, her face burned at the thought of the ignominious
separation her husband had planned. What did she care for Eden,
for the wealth he had sneeringly said she should not be deprived of,
now that she had lost him? All the latent pride within her rose in
arms against such terrible humiliation. She would have died, indeed,
would have faced the crudest death unflinchingly, rather than
have remained at Eden on such terms. Laurel had been a passionate,
loving, impulsive child till now. In the hour of her unutterable
desolation, she became a proud, cold, blighted woman. Her
sin had found her out. That time of which she had spoken to
Beatrix Wentworth and Clarice, saying that only when it came
could she repent of her fault, had come, and, metaphorically speaking,
she wore sack-cloth and ashes.</p>

<p>Death would have been welcome in that hour. She longed for it,
she prayed for it. It seemed to her quite impossible that she could
lose St. Leon and live. She had told herself often and often that, if
he refused to forgive her when he found her out, she should die. It
had seemed to her that her heart would stop its beating, her pulses
faint and fail in that terrible hour.</p>

<p>But the end had come, and the blood still pulsed through her
veins, her heart still beat, the young, strong life that thrilled her
held on its steady course. A great temptation came over her as she
crouched in the night and the darkness on the banks of the swirling
river. It would have been so pleasant, so sweet, to have ended the
short, sad story of her life, with its terrible temptation and cruel
failure, then and there&mdash;to have shut out the dark, foreboding future
in the merciful shadows of oblivion, but something&mdash;perhaps
that tender secret she had so shyly withheld from her husband&mdash;held
her back from the fatal plunge. Her own life she might have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in the frenzy of despair, but that other tenderer one throbbing beneath
her broken heart, she could not, she dared not.</p>

<p>"I have no right," she said to herself. "I might be wicked and
mad enough to commit suicide, but murder, never. No, no, I will
be brave. I will bear my cross for the sake of what is coming to
me. Who knows but that it may comfort me in my lonely future!
St. Leon will not want it. He would hate it and exile it from him
as he did me. It will be wholly mine&mdash;something of his that will
love me and cling to me although he scorns and despises me."</p>

<p>So she went away. She took with her none of the jewels, none of
the beautiful gifts her adoring husband had lavished upon her in the
happy days now forever past. She slipped her purse into her
pocket. It contained several hundred dollars. Pride would have
made her leave it, but she felt that for the sake of her tender secret
she had a right to take it with her. She would need it in the trial
that lay before her.</p>

<p>So she left the veil and gloves upon the river bank where they
would find them if they sought for her, and then she went to New
York and hid herself and her sorrow in the obscurity of the great,
thronged city, bearing her burden of sorrow alone and in pitiful
silence and despair.</p>

<p>Through the medium of the omnipresent newspaper she learned
of the tragedy that had occurred at Eden. As if it had been the
story of another she went over the fate of the beautiful impostor
who had been detected in her sin, and whose disappearance had been
followed by the finding of her drowned body. Then, indeed, she
started, wondering who the unfortunate river waif could have been
who had been buried with the honors pertaining to St. Leon Le
Roy's young wife.</p>

<p>"I will not undeceive them," she said. "Now, indeed, I am
dead to him forever, and that is best. Let him forget me."</p>

<p>Alone and without references, Laurel did not find it easy to secure
respectable lodgings in the city. She thought of returning to
the house where she had lived with her father, but a wholesome
dread of her base enemy, Ross Powell, held her back. She did not
think it would be prudent to venture into that vicinity, so she went
to a far-removed portion of the city, where she only secured the
cheap and decent lodgings she desired by the payment of several
months in advance. She was very well pleased to do this, for she
had made up her mind to remain in this quiet, obscure locality
until her trial was over. To her curious landlady she called herself
Mrs. Vane, and said that she was a widow.</p>

<p>As she had left all her clothing at Eden, Laurel found herself
compelled to draw again upon her small hoard of money. In accordance
with her <i>rôle</i> of a widow, she bought only black dresses,
and these of a cheap and simple kind. She put back her rich, golden
hair under an ugly widow's cap, and never ventured into the
street without a thick crape veil drawn closely over her face. She
did not feel that she was acting a falsehood in doing this. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
to herself that she was worse than widowed. She had been most
cruelly put away from her husband's heart for a sin that he ought
to have forgiven because she had loved him so dearly and had been
tempted so much beyond her power of resistance.</p>

<p>A strange cold bitterness began to grow up in her desolate young
heart toward him. She called him hard and cold and unloving in
her thoughts, because measured by her own passionate love his
affection fell so far below the standard where she would have placed
it. Laurel was all unversed in the lore of the world. She knew nothing
of the difference between male and female love. She had never
heard that couplet so wonderfully true that use has worn it threadbare:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis woman's whole existence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She did not know this&mdash;no one had ever told her so, and she was
fated to learn it in the hardest fashion by cruel experience. She was
learning, too, in all their subtle pathos the truth of those mournful
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas! the love of women, it is known<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To be a lovely and a fearful thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For all of theirs upon the die is thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And if 'tis lost life has no more to bring."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those were sad and heavy days that followed on her flitting to
New York. She was almost crazed with the bitterness of her despair.
There were weeks that were afterward almost a blank to her
because she spent them in tears that were like drops of blood wrung
from her aching, bleeding heart. She lay all day on her little bed
vainly dwelling on the irrevocable past, looking back on all that she
had lost with incurable longing and bitter regret. When this season
of lamenting had worn itself out, Laurel grew hard and proud and
tried to forget&mdash;a hard task that many, stronger than our little heroine,
have essayed in vain.</p>

<p>After awhile she found out that she would have to draw again on
the contents of her already diminished purse. There were garments
to be provided for the little stranger that was coming to brighten her
darkened life. She would not choose coarse, cheap garments now,
such as she had bought for herself. She selected the finest, whitest
linen, the softest, warmest flannel, the daintiest muslin, and was
even a little extravagant in the matter of dainty laces and Hamburg
trimmings. Then, when the complete and pretty outfit was laid
away, with lavender and rose-leaves between the snowy folds, Laurel
counted the few dollars that were left from her expenditures,
and became frightened.</p>

<p>"When it is all gone, what shall I do?" she asked herself,
blankly. "Where is the next to come from?"</p>

<p>And her startled reason harshly answered her: "You will have
to work for it. You will have to earn it."</p>

<p>Laurel did not know how to earn money. She had never been
taught any available thing, and her delicate condition of health precluded
the idea of going out into the busy world to toil. Besides,
her morbid sensibilities shrunk from the thought of encountering
strangers who would look upon her with coldness, perhaps suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>She was in despair at first, but she suddenly remembered how
easily and quickly her reckless, pleasure-loving father had earned
the wherewithal for their support.</p>

<p>"The publishers were always eager for papa's MSS.," she said to
herself hopefully; "and, being his daughter, I must have inherited
his genius. I will write."</p>

<p>She was not egotistical. She was simply ignorant of the world's
ways. She did not know how many failed in the world of letters,
where one succeeded. The idea took hold of her fancy, and without
a dream of failure, she armed herself with a ream of foolscap,
plenty of ink and pens, and went enthusiastically to work.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.</a></h2>


<p>Ill news flies apace. It was not long before Beatrix Wentworth,
leisurely reading her New York paper in London, came upon the
story of that tragedy on the beautiful Hudson&mdash;read the ending of
the strange story of love and temptation, for which she felt herself
in some degree responsible, since she herself had sent Laurel Vane
to Eden.</p>

<p>She threw down the paper and wept bitterly. It was true that she
had been angry with Laurel because she had deceived St. Leon Le
Roy. She had known that she would find it harder to be forgiven
for her elopement with Cyril since Laurel's willful marriage, but
in this moment she forgot her pique, her annoyance, her resentment
at Laurel's fault, and her heart was full of grief and pity over the
girl's sad fate. She remembered how young and fair and loving the
erring girl had been, and she said to herself that St. Leon Le Roy
had been too hard and cold when he found her out. He might have
forgiven her, he should have been kind and pitiful to her, at least,
for the sake of that mad love that had tempted her to sin.</p>

<p>Cyril agreed with her that the proud, rich man might have forgiven
the lovely, hapless girl for the sake of her great love. He had
felt so grateful to Laurel Vane for the service she had done him and
Beatrix, that he wished her the greatest good and the greatest happiness
that is possible to mortals. It came upon him with a great
shock, that the beautiful, dark-eyed girl, with the crimson lips, like
a pomegranate flower, and the shining, golden hair was dead&mdash;worse
than all, dead because she could not bear her life, driven into the
dark, cold river by the intensity of her despair. He wondered what
Mr. Le Roy's feelings could be.</p>

<p>"I should feel like a murderer," he said, to Beatrix. "It would
seem to me that with my own hand I had pushed the poor child
into the cruel river."</p>

<p>"He was so proud! All my life I have heard of the Le Roy
pride," said Beatrix. "I have felt frightened for Laurel, ever since
I found out what she had done. I never doubted that he would put
her away from him when he found her out; but I never dreamed
she would be driven to suicide. I thought that after awhile he
would forgive her and take her back."</p>

<p>She could not bear to think of the gentle, beautiful, golden-haired
girl, lying dead. She wept when she recalled her first meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
her, and the temptation that had entered her mind. How sadly
their girlish conspiracy had ended for the dead author's daughter.</p>

<p>"I was her evil genius, but I only meant to be kind to her," she
repeated, remorsefully, many times.</p>

<p>Even Clarice, who had been very angry with Laurel, and who
had judged her hardly at first, had nothing but tears and regrets for
the dead girl. Her passionate love that had ended in so sad a tragedy
set her apart in solemn sacredness. She had atoned for her fault
with her life.</p>

<p>"We must write to Mr. Le Roy," said Cyril Wentworth. "We
must confess all our fault in sending Laurel to Eden. We must tell
him how kind and true and sweet she was until her mad love led
her astray. We must beg him to forgive her now that she is dead."</p>

<p>Beatrix wrote. It was a brave though most pathetic letter. She
owned her fault in sending Laurel to Eden, she dwelt pathetically
on her temptation to do so. She begged his pardon for her fault,
and then she pleaded for Laurel dead as warmly and earnestly as if
she had been living to profit by the prayers of her friend. The page
was blistered by her tears, but no answer ever came to her earnest
appeal. It seemed that Mr. Le Roy was indeed hard and unforgiving.
He could not accord his pardon to any of the actors in the
strange drama that had shadowed his life.</p>

<p>Then Beatrix wrote to her parents, humbly acknowledging her
fault and praying their pardon. She loved them dearly although she
had deserted them for her handsome, adoring young lover. She
had a faint hope that they would forgive her and Cyril and bid
them come home. She longed for her father's kiss of welcome, her
mother's clasping arms.</p>

<p>Oh, how impatiently she waited for the answer to that letter!
How eagerly she longed to be pardoned for the girlish conspiracy
that had ended so disastrously to Laurel Vane! She began to see
her fault in a darker light now since the tragedy at Eden. The
shadow of Laurel's grave seemed to fall long and dark across her
wedded happiness!</p>

<p>An answer came at last from her outraged father&mdash;such an answer
as withered all the springing-hopes in her breast. They would
never forgive her for her fault. They had no longer a daughter.
Their Beatrix was the same as dead to them, and they wished never
to hear from Cyril Wentworth's wife.</p>

<p>St. Leon Le Roy sat alone in his handsome, spacious library.
He had been reading, but the book of poems had fallen from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hand, and he was dreamily repeating some lines that had touched
an aching chord in his heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"I want that rose so much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would take the world back there to the night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It once in that fair fall light;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And only once if I might."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Memory was busy at his heart, for time had not healed, it had
only seared the wound of years ago.</p>

<p>Eight years had come and gone since that terrible night when his
bitter anger and hard judgment had driven his erring childish wife
out into the darkness of death. Scarcely an hour ago he had stood
by the broken marble shaft that marked her grave and seen the
gray moss creeping over the sweet, simple name&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"LAUREL,<br />
Beloved wife of St. Leon Le Roy."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Beloved!</i> Yes, he had carved it on her tombstone when all too
late to save the broken heart that had loved him with a madness
that proved its own destruction. Beloved! ah, he never knew how
well until the slow years coming and going, "barren of all joy,"
had shown him how empty and hollow was all the world measured
with what he had lost. All his life was a long regret, an echo of
the poet's plaint:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, to call back the days that are not!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The years had marked his face with the story of their sadness.
Handsome as Apollo still, there were lines of pain about the cold,
proud lids, there were silver threads clustering in the raven locks
tossed carelessly back from the white brow, there were shadows always
lying <i>perdu</i> in the splendid dark eyes. For years he had been
a lonely wanderer by land and sea, but now that he had come home
again to Eden and to his mother, and to Laurel's grave, he found
that he had not forgotten&mdash;that he never could forget.</p>

<p>He had been standing by her grave where she had rested for eight
long years, he had read her name carved on the cold, white marble,
but back here in the room where he had wooed her for his wife,
where she had promised to be his, it seemed to him that he could
not make her dead. She haunted him&mdash;not in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The garments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dripping like cerement,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in which she had been drawn from her watery grave; but bright,
blushing, beautiful, as in those days forever past when she had come
to Eden first and made herself his fate.</p>

<p>His fate! Yes, it had come to that. The one woman who had
stirred his heart to its deepest depths, who had loved him so blindly,
and deceived him so terribly, had made herself his fate. He had
not forgotten her, he never would forget. He remembered the dark,
wistful eyes, the trembling smile of the crimson lips, the curling
golden hair, the warm, dimpled, white hands. Ah! only to clasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
them again, only to kiss the lovely responsive lips, what would he
not have given!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"But that rose is not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anywhere just now&mdash;God knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all the old sweetness goes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"If only I had forgiven her," he said to himself as he had said it
over and over in the long, weary years. "She was only a child and
the temptation was so great. I was hard and cold. I thought only
of myself, my own injuries. Poor little loving Laurel, driven to her
death by my hard judgment. Ah, that my sorrow, my love, my repentance
could bring her back!"</p>

<p>He bent his head wearily down upon his folded hands heedless of
the light, gliding step that came to his side, the soft touch that fell
upon his hair, the voice that breathed in loving sympathy, "My
son."</p>

<p>It was his mother. She knew where he had been, and her heart
was full of grief and sorrow for his hopeless pain. Yet she knew
that words were powerless to soothe the agony of remorse and pain
that filled his heart. She only came with her silent sympathy to be
near him because she loved him and shared in his grief.</p>

<p>He looked up at last, trying to seem cheerful for her sake, for
she, too, was sadly changed by the progress of the years. The soft
waves of hair that clustered on her brow had grown snowy white,
the high-bred patrician face was pale and sad, her voice had always
a tone of unconscious pathos in its low, clear modulations.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you have found me thus, mother," he said, seeing
the sorrowful tears shining in her gentle eyes. "Years should have
taught me to be brave and strong. But you know where I have
been. It brought the past all back, and temporarily unnerved me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But you will feel better by and by," she said
simply, feeling that silence was better than words before such grief
as his. It was a subject on which they never conversed. She had
felt it was a cruel and unkind act when she first learned of the interview
that St. Leon had refused to allow between her and Laurel that tragic
night. She had reproached him most bitterly for it once, but ever
since she had held her peace. There was that in his face, when she
looked at him, that told of a conscience never at rest, of a heart
whose self-reproaches were harder to bear than words of hers could
have been. She grew to be sorry for him, and never, by word or
sign, added to his pain; for the proud, lonely, disappointed old
woman idolized her stately son even yet, although by his hard, unforgiving
course toward Laurel Vane he had shattered the dearest
hope of her life.</p>

<p>That hope, that longing for an heir to Eden&mdash;for another Le Roy
to rule and reign at the grand old home on the Hudson, when she
and St. Leon should have passed away&mdash;was long since dead. She
had ceased even to hope that her son would ever marry again. She
saw how coldly and carelessly he turned from the fair faces that
smiled upon him, how restless and impatient he was under the requirements
of society. When he died, their fine estates, their vast
wealth, would have to pass to distant relations, mere strangers bearing
another name. It was hard, it hurt her pride cruelly, but she
said nothing to St. Leon. She kept her tears and her bitter lamentations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
for that quiet grave, where the unfulfilled hope of her life lay
buried in darkness forever. For the sake of that hope she had been
willing to forgive Laurel's deceit and duplicity. She would have
forgiven even more for the sake of holding her grandchild in her
arms.</p>

<p>It was too late now. St. Leon would never marry, would never
forget. With a smothered sigh, she tried to put the vexing thought
out of her mind, and with the same laudable intent toward St. Leon,
she roused herself and said, quietly:</p>

<p>"I do not believe I have told you yet, St. Leon, that we have new
neighbors at Belle Vue?"</p>

<p>Belle Vue was the country house next to them, and one almost as
beautiful as Eden. It was scarcely a mile away, and St. Leon
looked up with some little interest, as he inquired:</p>

<p>"What? Have the Armisteads sold out or gone away?"</p>

<p>"Both. Robert Armistead failed in his banking business, and it
involved the loss of his whole private fortune. He sold out everything,
and went West with his family to seek his fortune again."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for Armistead," said St. Leon Le Roy, in that vague,
conventional tone, in which one is usually sorry for the misfortunes
that do not touch himself. "And so there are new people at Belle
Vue?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they have been down about a month."</p>

<p>"Are they new rich people?" St. Leon asked, with some little
disdain.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do not know. I should say not, however," said his
mother. "People have taken them up very sociably. There is an
old gentleman, a Mr. Ford, quite a traveled man, I am told. His
niece lives with him, and her son. She is a widow, and literary."</p>

<p>"What has she written?" he inquires, with faint interest.</p>

<p>"Several novels&mdash;'Ermengarde,' 'The Curse of Gold,' 'Sacrificed,'
and some others. Mr. Gordon is her New York publisher,
but I think she has been in Europe lately with Mr. Ford."</p>

<p>Some little excitement gleams in his eyes.</p>

<p>"The author of 'Sacrificed' our nearest neighbor!" he exclaims.
"Why, mother, did you know that her books have made quite a stir
abroad as well as at home? They are quite the fashion."</p>

<p>"I am sure I liked them myself&mdash;the style is very fresh and pure.
Do you think we ought to call at Belle Vue, St. Leon? I have been
thinking that it is my duty to do so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. I will go with you, if you wish, some day. I am
just a little curious over the blue-stocking, but I dare say she is old,
and wears caps and spectacles," he answers, carelessly enough.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.</a></h2>


<p>"Laurie! Laurie! come and carry my flowers for me!" called
a voice.</p>

<p>It was sweet and clear as a chime of silver bells, but it pierced St.
Leon Le Roy's heart like a sword-point. It thrilled and quivered
through him, stirring him with a blended joy and pain. He listened,
and again the sweet voice cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, my son! Mamma is waiting for you."</p>

<p>They were calling at Belle Vue&mdash;St. Leon and his mother. Mr.
Ford had entertained them graciously in the splendid blue and gold
drawing-room, but Mrs. Lynn could not be found. "She must be
out walking," said her uncle, disappointedly, and after awhile he
invited them to come out into the rose-garden. She might be there,
he said. It was a favorite haunt of hers.</p>

<p>So, in the freshness and beauty of the July morning, they went
out into the graveled paths lying whitely in the sunshine, forming
such an exquisite contrast to the green grass and the beds of glorious
ever-blooming roses, with the morning dew still shining on their
bright petals; and while they walked that voice came to St. Leon
like an echo from the buried past&mdash;dead and buried for eight long
years.</p>

<p>"She is here. I will bring her to you," Mr. Ford says, nervously,
starting away from them; and they pause by a little crystal fountain
throwing up diamond spray into the clear, bright air, and wait&mdash;St.
Leon with his heart beating strangely, thrilled to blended ecstasy
and despair by a voice.</p>

<p>"Her voice is like&mdash;" Mrs. Le Roy begins; then shuts her lips
over the unspoken name, vexed with herself that she was about to
sadden the tenor of her idol's thoughts. "Let us walk on a little
further," she amends, abruptly, and a few more steps bring them
upon a picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford has found his niece. He is standing talking to her earnestly,
making no move to return to his guests. Perhaps he is explaining
to her the fact of their presence.</p>

<p>"Am I going mad?" St. Leon asks himself, with stern, set lips
and wildly staring eyes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"She is not of us, as I divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She comes from another, stiller world of the dead."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tide of years rolls backward. He has forgotten Mrs. Lynn the
authoress as if she had never been. This slender, stately woman
with her white hand resting lightly on Mr. Ford's arm is a ghost
from the past; the dark, uplifted eyes, the tender crimson mouth,
the waving, golden hair, are like hers whom, for a little while he believed
to be an angel, but finding her only a faulty mortal, he had
sternly put away from him. So like, so like, that he cannot take
his eyes from the white-robed form with the wide sun-hat tilted carelessly
back from the low white brow with its clustering waves of
sunny hair, and the white hands full of roses, most of them dewy
crimson, as if she loved that color best.</p>

<p>While he gazes like one stupefied, they turn and walk toward
him. St. Leon is conscious of a little admonitory pinch administered
by his mother's slim fingers, and tries to rouse himself to the
occasion. In a minute he is conscious of a lamentable failure as he
meets Mrs. Lynn's dark eyes upturned to his in calm surprise. She
is by far the cooler and calmer of the two, and directly he finds himself
walking by her side along the graveled path, the elder couple
pacing sedately after them.</p>

<p>He is aware that he has not distinguished himself in this meeting
with the gifted authoress. His words have been few and incoherent&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
worthy of St. Leon Le Roy. He rallies himself with a desperate
effort and makes the first remark that comes into his head:</p>

<p>"You like flowers, Mrs. Lynn?" is the hackneyed observation.</p>

<p>"I love them," she answers, quickly, and he is instantly reminded
of another who "loved," not "liked," the fragrant, dewy darlings.</p>

<p>"You see, I have gathered almost more than I can carry," she
goes on, looking lovingly at the great bunch in her hands. "I
called my son Laurie to help me, but he is chasing a butterfly, I
dare say, and out of sound of my voice."</p>

<p>"Permit me," he says, taking them courteously from her, and at
the unavoidable touch of their hands a hot crimson flush mounts to
his brow, his heart beats painfully.</p>

<p>"I must go away from here, presently," he says to himself, impatiently.
"I have no self-possession at all. What a ninny Mrs.
Lynn must believe me. And yet&mdash;and yet, she is so like a ghost
from my dead past that I lose my senses looking on her perfect
face!"</p>

<p>"We have some very rare flowers at Eden," he says, "I hope
you will come and see them since you are so fond of them. You
shall carry away all you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I shall be sure to come," she answers. "I know&mdash;I
have heard, I mean&mdash;that the flowers at Eden are wonderful."</p>

<p>"I hope they will justify your expectations," he says. "Shall
we sit down here and rest, Mrs. Lynn? You must be tired."</p>

<p>They sit down on a rustic bench side by side, and the elderly
couple follow suit at some little distance. It is a lovely morning and
a lovely scene.</p>

<p>The golden sunshine sifts down through leafy boughs all about
them, the air is sweet with the song of birds and the breath of flowers,
the blue waves of the Hudson are visible at some little distance,
lending additional beauty to the charming scene. Mrs. Lynn looks
away at the river and St. Leon looks at her, trying to convince himself
that her likeness to the dead is not so great as he had fancied.</p>

<p>"Laurel was a girl&mdash;this is a woman," he tells himself.</p>

<p>He is right. Mrs. Lynn is very young, but the sweet gravity, the
exquisite majesty of womanhood are stamped on her pure, white
brow. Thought, intellect, experience, are blended with her still
youthful beauty, in charming combination. Laurel had been a
beautiful rosebud, Mrs. Lynn was a perfect rose. And yet&mdash;he
said to himself&mdash;Laurel at twenty-five would have been Mrs. Lynn's
counterpart.</p>

<p>While she looked dreamily off at the river with those dark, heavily
fringed eyes and he looked at her, a silence fell between them. It
was broken by the laughter of a child. A beautiful boy came running
down the path toward them and stopped at his mother's knee.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, I am so tired," he panted, breathlessly, his rosy
lips parted with happy laughter, "and I did not catch my beautiful
butterfly after all!"</p>

<p>The lovely young mother turned toward her child. Her cheek
was very pale, there was a strange light in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Laurie, do you not see the gentleman?" she said. "Go and
speak to him. Mr. Le Roy, this is my son, Laurence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not blame her for the sweet ring of triumph in her voice.
The boy was as handsome and spirited as a little prince. He had
great, flashing dark eyes and clustering dark hair combined with
perfect features at once proud and gentle. His beautiful rosy lips
seemed made for smiles and kisses. His dark blue velvet suit set
off his fine spirited little figure to the greatest perfection.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy drew the manly little fellow to his side.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to make the acquaintance of so important a
person as Mrs. Lynn's son," he said. "How old are you, Master
Laurence?"</p>

<p>"Almost eight," said the little lad, and his mother amended in a
low voice, that had somehow a strange quiver in its sweetness,
"Seven and a half, Mr. Le Roy." Then in a sadder cadence, "The
only son of his mother, and she is a widow."</p>

<p>"I have no papa, Mr. Le Roy," said the manly little fellow, in a
tone of regret. "Other boys have fine times with their papas, they
tell me, but I do not even remember mine. He died before I was
born."</p>

<p>"Do not weary the gentleman with a recital of your family history,
my dear," interposed his mother, gently. "Go now and speak
to the lady who is sitting with Uncle Carlyle."</p>

<p>The child went away, followed by Mr. Le Roy's glance. He
could not understand the strange yearning that drew him to the
princely little lad.</p>

<p>"I have fancied you must be very proud of the books you have
written, Mrs. Lynn," he said, impulsively. "I can fancy that you
are prouder still of your son."</p>

<p>"I am," she answered, in a voice full of love and pride. "I cannot
tell you how I love my boy, Mr. Le Roy. It seems to me that
he is the most beautiful, the most intelligent, the most loving lad in
the world. Do you blame me?" suddenly lifting her dark, grave
eyes to his face. "Should not you be proud of such a son, Mr. Le
Roy?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not blame you," he answered. "I am quite sure I
should be proud of such a fine little son," and a thrill of sorrow and
self-reproach went through him as he recalled the words his mother
had spoken to him eight long years ago. "In a little while there
would have been an heir to Eden."</p>

<p>A buried hope! Ah! if only he had been a little less hard and
cold! If only Laurel had told him her precious secret! He must
have forgiven her then. He could not have withheld his pardon.</p>

<p>There was something in Mrs. Lynn's tone he could not understand.
Was it a taunt at his childlessness? Or was it only a mother's
triumph in her treasure? He looked at the beautiful face. It was
faintly flushed, the drooping lashes were dewy with unfallen tears.
Some deep emotion stirred her heart and made roses on her breast
rise and fall with its intensity. While he puzzled over it, there
came a startled cry from Mr. Ford. Mrs. Le Roy had fallen from
her seat in a dead faint.</p>

<p>St. Leon hastened to her. They raised her up, but it was some
little time before she recovered. None could understand what had
caused her swoon.</p>

<p>"She was sitting with Laurie on her knee talking very brightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and pleasantly, and quite suddenly&mdash;all at once, as it were&mdash;her arms
dropped from around the child and she fell like one dead," said Mr.
Ford. "I cannot understand it. Has your mother any heart disease,
Mr. Le Roy?"</p>

<p>"None, but she is not very strong," St. Leon answered. "She
very seldom goes out."</p>

<p>Then she opened her eyes and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Take me home, St. Leon," she said, "I am very tired."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynn pressed her cordially to remain at Belle Vue until she
was better.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot stay now," Mrs. Le Roy answered gravely. "But
you will pardon my display of weakness, Mrs. Lynn, and you will
come to see me soon&mdash;will you not?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynn promised with a smile that she would certainly accept
the invitation.</p>

<p>"And the child&mdash;you will be sure to bring him?" said Mrs. Le
Roy, kissing the wondering little face.</p>

<p>"If you wish it," assented the beautiful young authoress, and
her face grew paler still when Mrs. Le Roy impulsively kissed her
cheek. St. Leon wondered why her small hand was so cold as he
pressed it lightly at parting. He would have wondered yet more
could he have seen the white, agonized face she turned upon Mr.
Ford when they had gone away.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX.</a></h2>


<p>Carlyle Ford went up to the beautiful woman and took her
cold trembling hands gently in his. She was as pale as death, and
she shivered as if an icy wave had broken over her.</p>

<p>"My dear, this has been too much for you," he said. "I see
now that we should never have come here."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynn did not answer. She only drew her white hands from
his, and, sinking down, covered her face with them. She remained
thus some minutes, and her uncle saw that the bright tears were
raining through her fingers, and her graceful figure heaving with
deep emotion.</p>

<p>The child had returned to his sport with the butterflies and flowers
as soon as the visitors departed. They were alone, and in a little
while Mrs. Lynn looked up and brushed the tears from her beautiful
face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," she said. "It may be that I was
wrong to meet him at all. But, I had the greatest longing to see
him after all these years. And, after all, I was no coward, Uncle
Carlyle. I did not break down before <i>him</i>. I was calm and proud.
He did not dream that I was other than I seemed."</p>

<p>"No; you played your part well," he said. "I was delighted
with your dignity and grace. Mr. Le Roy was the more agitated
of the two. He was struck by the resemblance. He showed deep,
though repressed emotion."</p>

<p>"I think you give him credit for too much feeling," cried Mrs.
Lynn, with a scornful flash in her dark eyes. "He has forgotten
long ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Mr. Ford, "yet I am inclined to think otherwise.
And the lady&mdash;she could not keep her eyes off you and the
child. She could not help seeing the likeness between her son and
your son, I am sure. It was startling. The boy is much more like
Mr. Le Roy than he is like you. The same hair and eyes, the same
proud features, only he has your beautiful, tender mouth. Why
did the lady faint?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," Mrs. Lynn answered, drearily.</p>

<p>"I think she was unnerved by the resemblance. It brought back
the past too vividly. My darling, they have not forgotten, as you
think. I foresee a reconciliation," he said.</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Mrs. Lynn, with curling lips and flashing eyes.
"I may be weak enough to care for him still, but I can never forget,
and I will never return to him. I am a child no longer. I am
a woman, and my pride is equal to his own!"</p>

<p>The handsome, kindly face of old Mr. Ford looked grave and
puzzled.</p>

<p>"My dear, is it right to cherish such pride?" he asked, slowly.
"Were it not better to condone the past&mdash;to forgive and forget?
Are you right to keep the heir of Eden from his own?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Carlyle, are you anxious to get rid of me?" asked the
lovely, gifted woman, wistfully.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear! What should I do without you and the boy?"
he cried. "But I do not want to be selfish; I do not want to keep
St. Leon Le Roy's happiness from him."</p>

<p>The warm color flashed into her cheeks; she laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"His happiness!" she cried. "His happiness! In his pride and
cruelty he threw it away. He is as proud and cold now as he was
then. He would take me back no sooner now than he would then.
But why do we talk of these things? He will never have the
chance. He will never know the truth. They have raised a costly
monument to St. Leon Le Roy's <i>beloved wife</i>&mdash;for them that is the
end."</p>

<p>"Eight years," he said, musingly. "At least he has been faithful
to her memory. It is strange that he has not married again&mdash;if
not for love, at least for the sake of an heir."</p>

<p>She caught her breath sharply; her lovely face grew deathly white.</p>

<p>"Married! married!" she cried, sharply. "Why do you talk of
such things, Uncle Carlyle?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to pain you, Laurel," he answered. "But, my
dear, it seems so strange. Le Roy has a princely estate and fine old
name. It would be only natural if he should wish to leave it to his
own descendants."</p>

<p>"So he shall," she said. "When I am dead, he shall have Laurie.
I have everything arranged in the clearest fashion. There will
be no difficulty in proving his identity. But, Uncle Carlyle, do not
let us talk of these things. They hurt me."</p>

<p>"You want to be alone," he said. "Very well, dear; I will go
and play with my boy. Forgive me for saying those things that
hurt you; I did not mean to do so."</p>

<p>He went away, and Laurel sunk down wearily, her hands clinched
tightly together, a look of woe and dread on her lovely face.</p>

<p>"Married again!" she uttered, hoarsely. "Well, and if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
should, what is there to prevent him? Could I speak? would I
speak? No! And yet&mdash;ah, Heaven! the fatal glamour is on me
still. It is a mad love&mdash;nothing less!"</p>

<p>The wind sighed in the trees, the murmur of the river came to
her softly, the sweet, calm day seemed to woo her to forgetfulness,
but the beautiful woman who had won fame and wealth and honor
in those long years since she had been put away from her husband's
heart, sat silent, with a look of mute despair on her fair young face.
That mad love, that terrible temptation of her girlhood, had spoiled
her life.</p>

<p>"It is a mad love," she repeated to herself. "How my face
burned, and my heart beat, when I met him. All the old madness
surged up within me, the love, the sorrow, the shame at my deceit.
It is a wonder I did not fall down dead at his feet! No one ever
loved more deeply than I loved St. Leon Le Roy," she went on,
after a pause. "If he had forgiven me my fault that night when
he had found me out, I should have been the happiest woman in the
world, instead of being the most wretched, as I am! Ah! why did
I ever come back here? It was a blind mistake. It has reopened
the old wound, and it is bleeding, bleeding. Ah, Heaven, shall I
never learn indifference? Shall I never sear my cureless wound?
I must go away soon. I was weak and wild ever to have come here
with Uncle Carlyle."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon Le Roy and his mother had a very quiet drive homeward.
Both were busy with their own thoughts. The lady leaned
back against the cushions of the phaeton with closed eyes, and a
look of grave thought on her pale, wan features. St. Leon, with
his calm, dark eyes, and sternly set lips, was as much absorbed as
she was in grave and earnest thought. He sat very quietly holding
the reins, and neither spoke until they had reached home. Then,
when they were sitting together, St. Leon, with an open book before
him, her keen eyes noted that he had not turned a page for half an
hour, and she spoke abruptly:</p>

<p>"St. Leon, what do you think of the famous authoress?"</p>

<p>His head drooped still lower over his book, as he answered,
quietly:</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful and brilliant. I had not expected to find
her so young and fair."</p>

<p>"She is the loveliest woman I ever saw," said Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, simply, in his gravely quiet tone.</p>

<p>He did not care to talk. He was like one in a strange, trance-like
dream. His soul had been shaken and stirred to its depths by the
beautiful woman who had flashed before him with his dead wife's
face and voice and the crimson roses in her hands, such as Laurel
had loved to gather. The tide of time rolled backward, and in place
of the proud, calm woman, the gifted genius before whom he had
bowed to-day, came a vision of a simple, dark-eyed girl, wandering
through the grounds at Eden, flitting among the fragrant flowers,
herself the fairest rose of all. Did she love him, that beautiful impostor,
St. Leon Le Roy asked himself, as he had done many times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
before in the eight years, while that marble cross had towered above
the dead heart, whose secret now would never be told? Did she
love him, indeed? Had she sinned through her love, not for wealth
and position as he had believed that terrible night? And there came
back to him through the mist of years the memory of that beautiful,
tearful face, and the pleading voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, if only I had forgiven her!" he said to himself, in an agony
of remorse and regret. "She loved me. I was mad to doubt it.
Save for her one fault, her one deception, Laurel Vane was pure and
true and innocent. I was hard and cold. Few men but would
have forgiven her such a transgression for love's sake."</p>

<p>His face fell forward on the open pages of the book where he had
been reading drearily enough some mournful lines that seemed to
fit his mood:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glitters the dew and shines the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Up comes the lily and dries her bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But two are walking apart forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And wave their hands for a mute farewell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A light touch fell on the bowed head whose raven locks were
threaded with silver that grief, not time, had blanched. He glanced
up, startled, into his mother's wistful face.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, with a slight contraction of his straight, dark
brows.</p>

<p>There was a strange, repressed emotion in her face as she answered:</p>

<p>"It is not <i>well</i>, St. Leon. You are unnerved, troubled, thoughtful
even beyond your wont. Will you forgive me for asking why?"</p>

<p>The dark, inscrutable eyes looked at her gravely.</p>

<p>"I might turn your deeds upon yourself," he said. "Why did
you faint in the garden at Belle Vue to-day?"</p>

<p>She flushed, and then grew very pale again.</p>

<p>"I will tell you the truth," she said, "or a part of it at least. I
was unnerved and startled by the terrible resemblance of the beautiful
Mrs. Lynn to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lost wife," he said, slowly, filling up her painful pause.</p>

<p>"So you noticed it?" she said.</p>

<p>"Could one help it?" he asked in his slow, repressed voice.
"Why do you call it a terrible resemblance, mother?"</p>

<p>"She is so like, so like&mdash;she is the living image of what Laurel
must have been now if she lived! And the child, St. Leon, the
child&mdash;" she broke down suddenly, and burst into wild, hysterical
sobbing.</p>

<p>Shocked by the passionate grief so unusual in his stately lady-mother,
he drew his arm tenderly around her and led her to a seat,
kneeling down humbly before her.</p>

<p>"Mother, does the old wound still ache so bitterly?" he said, in
blended pity and remorse. "I had thought the pain of it was past.
Ah, I can never forgive myself for the madness, the cruelty, that
robbed you of the daughter you loved!"</p>

<p>"And the grandchild I expected," she sobbed bitterly. "Ah,
St. Leon, I can never forget how my hopes were blasted! Forgive
me for those weak tears, my son. All the old regret and sorrow were
stirred anew in my heart to-day by the sight of Mrs. Lynn and her
beautiful child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>He had no answer for her. He was too proud and reserved to tell
his mother the truth&mdash;that he, too, had been shaken by a ghost from
the past that day. He knelt by her silently, letting her sob out all
her grief and sorrow against his shoulder, and when she had grown
calmer he said, gently:</p>

<p>"Mother, dear, you must not see this Mrs. Lynn again. It agitates
you too much. After all, it is only a resemblance. She might
not feel flattered if she knew that we compared her with my simple,
little girl-wife, dead so long ago. Let me take you away to the seashore
or the mountains while Mrs. Lynn remains at Belle Vue."</p>

<p>But she negatived the proposition in extreme alarm.</p>

<p>"It could only afford me pleasure to see Mrs. Lynn again," she
declared. "I love her for her likeness to the dead. I am unwilling
to lose a single chance of seeing her. And I promise you, St.
Leon, that I will not lose my self-control again as I did to-day in
the first shock of meeting her. I will be as calm and cold as she is."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.</a></h2>


<p>A few days later Mr. Ford brought his niece and her son to call
at Eden.</p>

<p>The brilliant writer looked very elegant and distinguished in her
dress of soft, rich black silk and lace. A dainty bonnet of black
lace and gleaming jet rested on the dark golden waves of her hair,
and set off to the greatest advantage her blonde loveliness, lighted
by such dark and star-like eyes. A soft color glowed on her rounded
cheeks, and her eyes were bright with repressed excitement, but
no trace of her heart's emotion showed in her calm, gracious manner
as she bowed to her handsome host and greeted his stately
mother. She had schooled herself to calmness, and no heartless
queen of society ever bore herself with more <i>nonchalant</i> ease and
outward coldness than did Laurel in the hour when she re-entered
the home she had left long years before, a wretched, despairing
child, for whom life seemed over and done. Now, as she stepped
across the threshold, a beautiful, proud, successful woman, whom
the world delighted to honor, she remembered that broken-hearted
child with a pang of bitterness that steeled her heart to the softness
that had melted it for a moment. She <i>would</i> be cold and calm for
the sake of the girl so cruelly put away from her husband's heart,
so cruelly misjudged and scorned. Yet, as it all rushed over her
again, she wondered, as she had wondered over and over in the past,
how she had lived through her sorrow&mdash;that sorrow which she had
said so many times would kill her when it came.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The day drags through, though storms keep out the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She said the pathetic lines over to herself, wearily, even as she
touched St. Leon's hand with her own and looked at him with a
smile&mdash;a smile bright but cold like moonlight on snow. He had no
answering smile in return. His face was almost stern in its marble
pallor and intensity of repressed emotion. His firm white hand
was cold as ice as it touched the rosy palm so graciously extended;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
his voice had a strange tone, even to himself, as he welcomed her to
his home.</p>

<p>"You have the most beautiful home on the Hudson. Eden is far
more beautiful than Belle Vue," she said to him, with her bright,
cold smile.</p>

<p>"I am glad you like my home. It will always have an added
charm in my eyes since Mrs. Lynn has deigned to praise it," St.
Leon answered, gallantly.</p>

<p>She thanked him almost mockingly, and then their conversation
turned upon the safe ground of generalities&mdash;upon art, and books,
and foreign travel, where both were at home. He found Mrs. Lynn
his equal in every sense. Her mind was rarely cultured and stored
with knowledge, her thoughts were beautiful and crystal clear. She
held her own with the ease and grace of one who knew the world,
yet retained the native innocence and frankness of a child. St.
Leon's hauteur and reserve melted before the charm of her manner,
and he became his natural self again, meeting her on her own
ground with polished words and brilliant thoughts. Their glances
met each other's calmly, telling no tales of that "auld lang syne"
when "eyes looked love to eyes that spake again."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Two maskers! what had they to do<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With vows forsworn and loves untrue?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy gave her attention to Mr. Ford and the child. She
had drawn little Laurence to a seat by her side, and was showing
him some fine engravings. She could not keep her fascinated eyes
from the beautiful, spirited, boyish face that bore such a startling
resemblance to that of her own son. Mr. Ford watched her closely,
and he saw that her heart had gone out to the child, and that she
was trying to win his love in return. He looked on approvingly,
longing, in the depths of his unselfish heart, for a reconciliation between
the long-parted husband and wife.</p>

<p>"Neither one is happy," he said to himself, looking at them as
they sat talking calmly like strangers&mdash;the proud husband and the
proud wife. "That man has a story written on his face; he has
suffered intensely; is it possible he does not suspect the truth? Can
he look at her&mdash;speak to her&mdash;and not recognize her? It almost
seems impossible. There was never beauty before like hers&mdash;never
such winsomeness and artless grace. Before I came here I despised
St. Leon Le Roy. Why is it that I pity him now? Is it because I
can read his sorrow and repentance in the sadness of his face?"</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy, rising at that moment, said, quietly, looking at his
mother:</p>

<p>"I am taking Mrs. Lynn to the library, mother, to show her a
book we have been discussing, if you and Mr. Ford will excuse us."</p>

<p>"Certainly," both answered in a breath; and they went away,
followed by Mrs. Le Roy's startled glance.</p>

<p>"Your niece is very beautiful," she said, turning back, after a
moment, to Mr. Ford. "Has she been long a widow?"</p>

<p>"Seven years," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then the child has never known his father?" she said, with a
light, pitying touch of her ringed white hand on the boy's dark,
clustering curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;much to the lad's regret," said Mr. Ford.</p>

<p>"I dare say you have acted a father's part by the fatherless one,"
she remarked, turning her grave, questioning eyes on his face. It
seemed as if she was fascinated to speak of little Laurence. She
could not keep her eyes nor her thoughts from him.</p>

<p>"Since I have known him&mdash;yes," Mr. Ford answered. "But
though his mother is my own sister's child, Mrs. Le Roy, I never
met her, never knew of her existence, until she was a widow, with
a son three years old."</p>

<p>She looked the curiosity she was too well bred to express in words.</p>

<p>"Do you care to know the reason why?" asked Mr. Ford.</p>

<p>"I confess you have aroused my curiosity," she replied, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you," he said. "When I was quite a lad I ran
away to Australia, seized with a gold-fever, then very prevalent in
New York. After years of ill luck, sickness, and misfortune, I
struck a bonanza. I was an old man then, and my heart yearned
for the home and the friends of my youth. I came home, determined
to share my wealth and prosperity with them, but all were
dead, mother, father, and even the toddling little sister I had loved
so dearly. She had married, and died in a short time after, leaving
one daughter, whom I found it impossible to trace. Several years
later, I discovered my missing niece, by a fortunate accident, in the
brilliant novelist, Mrs. Lynn."</p>

<p>"She is very young to have achieved fame in the literary world,"
said the lady.</p>

<p>"The result of necessity, my dear madam," Mr. Ford replied.
"Losing her husband before the birth of her child, my niece, scarcely
more than a child herself then, was thrown upon her own resources
for support. She became a writer, and most fortunately for
the sake of the little, helpless being dependent upon her care, she
succeeded where the many fail," he ended, leaving Mrs. Le Roy's
unspoken curiosity on the subject of Mrs. Lynn even greater than
before, through his meager explanation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Le Roy led his beautiful guest to the library, and placed a
chair beside the table where he usually sat to read. Laurel sat silently
a moment with averted face. She was fighting down her
heart, thrusting back the memories that would arise like pallid
ghosts from the dead past. Here in this room, nay, in this very
chair where she was sitting, St. Leon had wooed her for his wife.
She could be cold and proud in the grand drawing-room. It was
there that he had put her away from him, there that he had spoken
the cruel, angry words that sundered their hearts and lives forever.
The memory of that night and that scene hardened her heart to her
unforgiving husband, and helped her to be cold and careless. Here
it was all different. This quiet retreat was hallowed by some of the
sweetest moments of her life.</p>

<p>That hour which had lifted her from dumb, jealous misery and
despair to the heights of bliss had come to her here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>The memory of her year of wedded happiness rushed over her
with all the love and joy that had been crowded into it.</p>

<p>She trembled, she recalled all the horror and despair that had followed
after, and for a moment it seemed to her that all was a hideous
dream from which she would awaken presently. She longed
to cry out aloud, to rush from this haunted room, to do anything
that would free her from the gaze of those sad, dark eyes, whose
burning glances as they sought her face seemed to read her secret
and to plead with her for love and reconciliation. A smothered
gasp, and she shook off the dangerous, luring spell, and became herself
again, calm, indifferent, yet gracious, the woman that slighted
and scorned love had made "icily splendid," fatally fair, as many
a man had owned to his cost.</p>

<p>She looked about for something to divert her attention, and saw
just at her hand lying on the table a volume elegantly bound in crimson
and gold. She took it in her hand and read aloud the gold-lettered
title on the back: "Laurel Blossoms."</p>

<p>"Laurel Blossoms," she repeated, and turned to the title-page.
With widening eyes and a swift color that went and came from
white to red and from red to white she read: "By Louis Vane."</p>

<p>St. Leon had drawn a chair near her. He spoke to her now in a
calm, carefully modulated voice that went far toward restoring her
shattered equanimity.</p>

<p>"That is a collection of tales and essays, Mrs. Lynn, arranged by
myself for publication. The author is long since dead. He was my
wife's father."</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, turning the precious pages slowly with
her trembling hands, her eyes downcast, and bravely keeping back
their threatening tears.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some one has told you the romantic story of my marriage,
Mrs. Lynn?" he said, watching the fair, drooping face with
earnest eyes.</p>

<p>She shook her head. She would not trust herself to speak.</p>

<p>"No?" he said. "Then perhaps I will tell you some day myself.
You love romance and tragedy, I infer, from your books.
My marriage had the elements of both in it."</p>

<p>She bowed again silently. It was quite impossible for her to utter
a word just then; but she said to herself, with a sort of passionate
disdain, that he was very daring, indeed, to speak to her of his marriage&mdash;to
her, of all women in the world.</p>

<p>He went on in his quiet, musical tones:</p>

<p>"Louis Vane was a genius, but, like many another gifted spirit,
he smirched the glorious talents given him in the degradation of
strong drink. He loved pleasure better than fame. But for his
weakness and his madness he would have made a name that must
have gone ringing down the ages."</p>

<p>She was silent, steeling her heart to the sweetness of those words
of praise. She remembered that strong, sweet voice that praised
Louis Vane for his genius now, denouncing and scorning her that
night, long years ago, as a "drunken journalist's daughter."</p>

<p>"When my wife died, seven years ago," went on St. Leon, "I
made it my duty and my pleasure to gather her father's miscellaneous
writings from the journals and magazines where they were scattered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and publish them in one volume, that they might be rescued
from oblivion and preserved for the pleasure of his admirers. The
book had a great sale. It was very popular. Have you never seen
it before, Mrs. Lynn?"</p>

<p>Again she shook her head in silence.</p>

<p>"Then let me beg your acceptance of this copy. I should like
you to read it. I assure you it will repay perusal. You may wonder
at its fanciful name. My dead young wife was called Laurel.
Is it not a sweet name? In memory of her I called it 'Laurel Blossoms'!"</p>

<p>Would he never have done speaking? A strange softness was
stealing over her heart that frightened her. No other atonement on
earth could have touched and moved her like this one. It was what
she could have wished most upon earth&mdash;to have her father's brilliant
essays collected into this beautiful volume, and yet she had
never thought of doing it herself. A pang of self-reproach pierced
her heart.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, father," she whispered, inly, as if the dead were
present in spirit, and could know and feel her mute repentance. "I
have been so absorbed in my own selfish sorrows and triumphs I forgot
to rescue your genius from the oblivion that must have ingulfed
it but for this man's effort."</p>

<p>All this while he was waiting for an answer. What must he think
of her strange silence? With a great effort she lifted her eyes to his
face, and said, in tones ringing with latent sarcasm and incredulity:</p>

<p>"You must have loved your wife very dearly, Mr. Le Roy?"</p>

<p>"More than I knew," he answered, simply, and the tone even
more than the words betrayed the burden of remorse and sorrow his
heart had borne for years.</p>

<p>She rose abruptly with the precious volume of her father's writings
clasped tightly in her hands. She was afraid to stay longer&mdash;afraid
of that sweet and subtle pity that thrilled her woman's heart.</p>

<p>"I have made too long a call for a first visit," she said. "Another
time will do for the books of which we spoke. The 'Laurel
Blossoms' made me forget."</p>

<p>"You have forgotten the flowers I promised to show you, too,"
he said. "Let me take you to the garden now."</p>

<p>"Some other time. I must really go now," she said, feeling that
for this one day she had already borne all that she could bear.</p>

<p>He did not urge the point. Perhaps the trial was as hard for him
as for her.</p>

<p>"Will you drive with me to-morrow?" he asked, as he touched
her hand at parting. "There are some beautiful views in this vicinity
that I should like to have the pleasure of showing you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go," she answered, hastily, unable to deny herself
the blended bliss and pain of his companionship even while she despised
herself for what she disdainfully termed to herself her
woman's weakness.</p>

<p>To-morrow came&mdash;one of the fairest of summer days, with a sea-blue
sky and the goldenest sunshine and most fragrant flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Laurel prepared for her drive with Mr. Le Roy with a beating heart.
She felt that she was acting imprudently in going with him, for she
scarcely dared trust herself in his presence; but she could not draw
back from her promise. An irresistible fascination drew her on to
the meeting with the husband so hopelessly and madly loved in the
long years while she wandered afar from him, an alien from his
home and heart.</p>

<p>Some strange thoughts were stirring in her heart, evoked by his
looks and words. She could scarcely fail to see that he had repented.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if he knew that Laurel Vane was living, he would
forgive her and take her back. Her fault might not seem so black
and bitter now, seen through the kindly veil of years," she said to
herself. "He might even love and trust me again."</p>

<p>But there came to her a sudden remembrance of words he had
spoken long ago, when he had told her of Maud Merivale's deceit
and falsity.</p>

<p>"I could never again love a woman who had deceived me. Once
fallen from its pedestal, the broken idol could never be restored
again."</p>

<p>She looked at the beautiful, passion-pale face reflected in the glittering
mirror, and a hopeless sigh drifted across her lips.</p>

<p>"I am a 'broken idol,'" she said, drearily. "I have fallen from
my place in his heart, and I can never be taken back, St. Leon is
too proud to forgive my girlhood's sin."</p>

<p>She had not been unloved in all these years. Proud men and
gifted had bowed before her, won by her beauty and her genius.
They marveled at her coldness, her indifference. No one guessed
at the mad love lying deep in her heart under the ashes of the dead
years&mdash;a smoldering fire that in the past few days had leaped into a
living flame. It needed all her strength, all her pride, to fight it back.
She went with him, and when he saw her he could scarcely repress
a startled cry. She had chosen the colors that always became his
young wife best&mdash;white and scarlet. Her white hat and a wreath of
scarlet poppies; some scarlet passion-flowers were fastened in the
neck of her white dress. She was so like&mdash;so like his dead wife that
it would only have seemed natural to have taken her in his arms and
kissed her and called her by the name of the dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they paused before the white gates of a great, wide
inclosure, she uttered a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>"This is the cemetery, Mr. Le Roy! Surely, you did not mean to
bring me here!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, and helped her down from the landau and
led her into the grim necropolis of the dead.</p>

<p>She did not understand. She walked by him, silent and frightened,
among the gleaming marbles, the dark-green shrubbery, the
beautiful flowers with which loving hearts had decorated the graves
of their dead. She heard her husband dreamily repeating some sad
familiar words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The massy marbles rest<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the lips that we have prest<br /></span>
<span class="i5">In their bloom:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the names we loved to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Have been carved for many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i5">On the tomb."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly he drew her hand in his arm, and led her down a
shaded green alley-way. In a minute they paused before a little
plot of ground whose velvet-green turf was bright with beds of rarest
flowers. In the midst was a single grave, with roses and passion-flowers
trailing over it. Laurel lifted her eyes and read the name
cut deep into the gleaming marble shaft.</p>

<p class="center">
"LAUREL,<br />
Beloved wife of St. Leon Le Roy."<br />
</p>

<p>She felt a strangely hysterical inclination to laugh out aloud.
How strange it seemed to stand there, so full of life and youth and
passion, and read her own name carved upon a gravestone! How
strange, how horrible to feel that, standing there by her husband's
side, she was as dead to him as if, indeed, her lifeless clay were
moldering in that low, green grave!</p>

<p>His low, deep voice broke the trance of hysterical horror that held
her senses enchained:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynn, I told you yesterday that there were elements of romance
and tragedy in my marriage that might interest even you. I
promised, too, that I would tell you the story some day. Here, at
poor Laurel's grave, I propose to keep my word."</p>

<p>He found her a seat, and she waited silently to hear him speak.
She was most curious to hear the story of her girlhood's love and
temptation told by her husband's lips from his own standpoint.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIV" id="CHAPTER_LIV">CHAPTER LIV.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon Le Roy threw himself down on the green turf at Mrs.
Lynn's feet, and resting his arm on his wife's grave, leaned his head
in his hand. So resting he could look up and note every expression
of the beautiful face above him&mdash;the face, deathly pale with emotion
now, for all she tried so bravely to appear politely calm and interested
like the stranger she pretended to be.</p>

<p>"Do you care to hear this story I am about to tell you?" he asked,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall be interested," she replied, gently, and thus
encouraged he began.</p>

<p>"It is more than nine years ago now that my mother received a
letter from a lady friend in New York&mdash;Mrs. Gordon, the wife of
the well-known publisher&mdash;perhaps you know him, Mrs. Lynn," he
said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gordon is my publisher," she replied.</p>

<p>"He had an only child&mdash;a beautiful daughter," said Mr. Le Roy.
"She had betrothed herself to a poor young man of whom her
parents disapproved. They proposed to break off the match by
strategy, if possible. They sent their daughter to Eden to remain a
few months, proposing to send her lover abroad during her absence,
and so separate them as to end the affair in the quietest manner possible."</p>

<p>He paused, but she made no comment on his words, only inclined
her golden head attentively.</p>

<p>"I was five-and-thirty years old when Beatrix Gordon came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Eden, she a beautiful child of sixteen," went on St. Leon, slowly, as
if looking back into the past. "Perhaps you will think I was too
old for her, Mrs. Lynn, but my heart was carried by storm, as it
were, by the lovely girl. I think almost from the first hour of our
meeting I recognized my fate in her. She was like no other woman
I ever met. If I talked to you all day, Mrs. Lynn," said St. Leon,
looking deep into her eyes with his dark, mesmeric orbs, "I could
never portray in words her beauty and sweetness. There was a
charm of novelty about them. She was rarely original. She was
afraid of me at first. <i>That</i> piqued me, although it was my own
fault. Very soon I found that my pique was the offspring of unconscious
love. I, St. Leon Le Roy, who despised women, who had
been angry at first at the girl's coming, had lost my heart to the slip
of a girl who belonged to another. The bitter consciousness of that
latter fact aroused my jealousy and added fuel to the fire of my passion.
I was angry with myself, ashamed of myself, yet I could no
more have checked the course of my strong, passionate love than I
could have stemmed the tide of a rushing river. Can you understand
me, Mrs. Lynn?"</p>

<p>She answered quietly, "Yes," but to her own heart she said:
"Ah, if he only knew."</p>

<p>"Then you may guess something of what I suffered," said St.
Leon, and for a moment he was silent, and his gaze turned from her
face, as he seemed lost in retrospection. She looked at the dark,
haughtily handsome face, and her heart thrilled within her. It had
all its old, luring, magnetic charm for her. She had repented her
fault long ago; she was sorry for her sin, bitterly sorry, but looking
on her husband's face now, she did not wonder that she had sinned
for his sake. In spite of time, in spite of pride, the old love was
strong within her. She might have exclaimed, with Byron:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I deemed that time, I deemed that pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Had quenched at length my early flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor knew till seated by thy side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My heart in all save hope the same."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was well for her that when he resumed his story he did not look
up. Too much of her heart was written on her lovely, mobile face.</p>

<p>"From the despair of my jealous love and misery, I wakened to
passionate bliss," he continued. "I know not when the child's first
shyness and dread of me changed to a tenderer feeling, but it came
upon me suddenly, and with heavenly sweetness, that she loved me.
She had forgotten her lover in New York. Mrs. Lynn, I swear I believed
she loved me even as I loved her, with a singleness and depth
of devotion such as few hearts are capable of feeling. God forgive
me that I doubted her once! No one was ever more cruelly punished
for unbelief and hardness than I have been!"</p>

<p>With his eyes downcast upon that low, green grave, he did not
see how bitterly her lip curled as it always did when that night of
her betrayal rushed bleakly over her.</p>

<p>"She gave me her tender, trusting heart, and her beautiful self,"
he went on. "We were married. Her parents were absent, and it
was a very quiet ceremony in a quiet church that gave me the desire
of my heart. We went abroad for our honeymoon, and remained
more than a year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>A sigh, heavy with his heart's despair, drifted over his lips.</p>

<p>"<i>Such</i> a year, Mrs. Lynn!&mdash;a golden year, into whose short space
was crowded all the real happiness and bliss of my life. She made
me the happiest, most blessed of men in that brief time. I am forty-four
years old, Mrs. Lynn, but, it seems to me I have only really
lived one year&mdash;one year that shines on me from the past like a
radiant star in the darkness of night."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LV" id="CHAPTER_LV">CHAPTER LV.</a></h2>


<p>Laurel felt a dreary kind of pleasure in hearing her husband
ascribe to her the only real happiness of his life. It was some atonement
for all that she had borne, all that she had suffered. Her heart
beat quick and fast beneath her white robe. He went on sadly:</p>

<p>"Never was there a stormier ending to a beautiful, sunny, summer
day, never a sadder waking from a happy dream. And it was all so
swift and sudden. It was like Burns' poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'No pause the dire extremes between,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She made me blest and broke my heart.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, yes, Laurel could remember how swift and sudden it had all
been&mdash;how like a thunderbolt falling from a clear sky. She sat
there pale and silent, and listened to her own story told by her husband's
lips, and felt a strange, dreary, aching pity for the girl who
had loved and suffered so much quite as if it had been another
woman than herself.</p>

<p>"We came home at last," he said. "My mother was very ill,
and my wife nursed and tended her unweariedly, and with all a
daughter's devotion, until she became convalescent. Then the hour
of my awakening came. It was so swift, so horribly sudden, I
wonder sometimes that it did not kill me."</p>

<p>Ah, she had wondered so often that she, too, had not died beneath
the stroke of that cruel fate. But she made no sign, she only sat
still and looked at the bowed head before her, and listened to his
words.</p>

<p>"The Gordons came down from New York one day quite unexpectedly,
to visit their daughter. I was delighted, Mrs. Lynn, because
I thought it would add to my darling's happiness. I thought
I would surprise her, so I concealed the fact of their arrival, and led
her into their presence full of happiness myself in the prospect of
witnessing her amazement and joy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynn held her costly fan before her face a moment. She
did not want him to see the spasms of agony that convulsed her face.
Ah, how bitterly it all rushed over her, the pain, the shame, the
horror of that supreme moment he was now portraying.</p>

<p>"You are smothering a yawn behind your fan," he said. "Does
my story weary you, Mrs. Lynn? It has not developed into a plot
for a novel yet, has it? You see I have been telling it in the plainest
fashion. I have not embellished it like a story-writer. And, besides,
up to the moment of which I have spoken it had not developed any
phases of the tragic. It had only been the simplest, sweetest love
idyl that was ever lived."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is perfectly true," she said to herself, with a burning face
and a strangely throbbing heart.</p>

<p>"But in the moment when I led my beautiful wife into the drawing-room
at Eden to meet her parents the <i>dénouement</i> came," said
St. Leon Le Roy. "The tragic element entered my story then. Can
you guess what happened, Mrs. Lynn?"</p>

<p>"Your wife was properly surprised, and glad to see her parents,
I presume," said Mrs. Lynn, with an air of polite interest.</p>

<p>His dark lashes lifted, he gazed at her sadly a moment, then they
fell again.</p>

<p>"No one could guess what <i>did</i> take place," said Mr. Le Roy.
"It was like a romance. You have never written anything stranger
in all your novels, Mrs. Lynn. But you must not expect me to describe
it to you in the language of fiction. Your own imagination
must invest it with all the eloquence it merits. I have been surprised
at many things in my life, Mrs. Lynn, but I was never more surprised,
never more shocked, than I was in the moment when I led
my Beatrix up to her mother. I had expected demonstrations of delighted
affection, I beheld only utter dismay and confusion. Can
you believe it, Mrs. Lynn? My young wife and the Gordons had
never met before in their lives!"</p>

<p>A faint murmur came from her lips, meant to convey surprise.
He accepted it as such, and went on slowly:</p>

<p>"Then it all came out. I had been deceived. I had been made
the victim of a clever conspiracy. Two beautiful, clever girls had
plotted together and the result was this: Beatrix Gordon had never
come to Eden. She had gone away and married her lover, and she
had sent Laurel Vane to us in her place. It was cleverly planned,
as I have said just now, but I have often wondered how Laurel carried
it out, and escaped detection. She was innocent and transparent
as a child. She was frightened always, I know, for when all came
out I could recall many things that pointed to the truth if only I had
not been so blind. But fate helped it on, and made me the husband,
not of Beatrix Gordon, the daughter of the wealthy, well-born publisher,
but of Laurel Vane, the penniless orphan child of an author
who, with the genius of an Edgar Allan Poe, had shared all the
weaknesses of the great poet and died as miserable."</p>

<p>He paused, Laurel wondered if he could hear her heart beating in
the stillness of that place of graves. It sounded so loudly in her
ears, it almost drowned his voice.</p>

<p>It was only by the greatest effort of her pride and will that she
preserved her outward calmness.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible discovery for me to make," he said. "I was
wounded in my love, in my faith, in my pride. Can you imagine
what I did, Mrs. Lynn?"</p>

<p>He had lifted his drooping head, and was looking straight into her
face. She looked back at him steadily, almost scornfully, as she replied:</p>

<p>"You loved her so dearly, and she made you so happy, perhaps I
should not err if I said that you forgave the girl for her sin."</p>

<p>He crushed back something like a groan upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Do you think I should have done so, Mrs. Lynn?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know how to answer you," she said, and her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
trembled. "From a woman's standpoint, I should answer yes.
But men are unlike women, are they not?&mdash;harder, colder, prone to
harsh judgments!"</p>

<p>"Yes, men are harder," he said, and was silent until she broke
the strange stillness with her strange voice.</p>

<p>"Do you love Tennyson, Mr. Le Roy? I do. I think one of the
grandest, most beautiful passages in the book is King Arthur's forgiveness
of Guinevere's terrible sin. Do you remember those words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God forgives'?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Her sin was not like Guinevere's," he said, hastily.</p>

<p>"And therefore the more easily to be forgiven," she said. "Do
you not think that your wife suffered for her sin? And, after all, it
was for love's sake. And women do and dare so much for love's
sake, remember."</p>

<p>"You are speaking as if I did not forgive her," he said. "I had
not told you that yet."</p>

<p>"But I fancied it must be so," she said, "because this is her
grave."</p>

<p>The shot went home. He shivered, and a hollow groan escaped
his lips.</p>

<p>"Would she have died for such a cause?" he asked, and she answered
gravely, and with a touch of sadness.</p>

<p>"Women's hearts have broken for even lighter causes."</p>

<p>To herself she said, mournfully: "I should have died myself if
it had not been for little Laurie's coming. I could not have lived
through these weary years if it had not been for the little child that
loved me!"</p>

<p>"<i>Her</i> heart was broken then," he said, "for I refused to forgive
her, Mrs. Lynn. I was hard and stern and angry. But I never
dreamed what would happen."</p>

<p>"What did she do?" inquired the brilliant novelist, with interest.</p>

<p>"She went away that night, Mrs. Lynn, and all search for her
proved futile and vain. In a few days after a body washed up from
the river&mdash;a young, golden-haired woman. They said it was Laurel,
my missing wife. You know the rest. This is her grave."</p>

<p>Laurel looked at the grassy mound with a strange dreary wonder
over the waif whom they had buried there. She wondered what
her name and history had been. "Perhaps as sad as mine," she
sighed to herself.</p>

<p>"This is her grave," he repeated. "Ah, Mrs. Lynn, you have a
glowing, vivid imagination. Can you fancy what I have suffered?
Can you comprehend how the demons of remorse and despair have
pursued me unceasingly?"</p>

<p>"Then you repented when too late?" she said.</p>

<p>"Too late," he echoed, drearily. "Yes, I repented when <i>too
late</i>. Ah, Mrs. Lynn, are there any sadder words than those two in
the English language?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," she replied. "You remember what the poet
Whittier has written?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The saddest are these: "It might have been."'"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>"'It might have been,'" he repeated. "Ah, yes, I can testify
to all the sadness of those words! Have I not felt it all? Since she
died my life has been one dreary penance, one long regret. Ah,
Mrs. Lynn, if only I had forgiven her&mdash;if only I had not driven her
from me by my harshness and cruelty! I was a fool, and blind.
She loved me and made me happy. She sinned through her love,
first, for Beatrix Gordon, then for me. Her story is the saddest, the
most pitiful I ever heard or read. I should have forgiven the child&mdash;she
was nothing but a child, and she had not been well taught.
But it was all so sudden, and I was half dazed by the shock. Ah,
well, I have had ample time to repent my haste and madness. The
years have been long and dreary enough without my darling. Every
time I come here to this quiet grave I whisper to the silent dust beneath:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh, to call back the days that are not!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My eyes were blinded, your words were few,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do you know the truth now up in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Laurel, Laurel, tender and true?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How the sweet passion and sorrow of the words moved her! He
was sorry for his cruelty, he repented it all. She said to herself that
if she had really been dead in that grave beneath him, she must have
heard those words&mdash;they would have thrilled even her dust. Tennyson's
beautiful words came into her mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My dust would hear him and beat<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Had it lain for a century dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would start and tremble under his feet<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And blossom in purple and red."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He looked up at her sitting there so fair and young, and so like
the dead, and his heart went out to her in passionate adoration. He
cried out, hoarsely, in his deep emotion:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynn, what do you think? Have I really sinned beyond
forgiveness? If Laurel could come back from the world of shadows,
do you think she would forgive me for that night?"</p>

<p>"Are you asking me to tell you what I should do in your wife's
place, Mr. Le Roy?" she asked him in a low, strange voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, put yourself in her place," he replied. "Tell me, could
you forgive me and love me again after the coldness with which I
put my wife from me that night?"</p>

<p>"I do not believe I could ever forget or forgive such unkindness,"
she replied.</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly, with a brooding trouble in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not look at the subject quite as my young wife
would have done," he said, anxiously. "Laurel loved me, Mrs.
Lynn. Do not forget that. Would she not forgive me for love's
sweet sake?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not think she would. Her pride would be stronger
than her love," answered the beautiful woman.</p>

<p>"Laurel was not proud," said St. Leon Le Roy.</p>

<p>"Not when you loved her, not when she was happy," said Mrs.
Lynn. "But can you not fancy the sweetness of even such a nature
as hers turned to gall by wrong and ruth? I repeat it, Mr. Le
Roy, if I were in your Laurel's place, if I could come back after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
those years, I believe I should be as proud and cold as I was gentle
once, I do not believe I could forgive you!"</p>

<p>He sprung up, he held out his arms to her yearningly, his face
transfigured by the yearning passion of his heart.</p>

<p>"Laurel, Laurel, do not speak to me so cruelly, do not judge me
so hardly!" he cried. "Do you think I do not know you, my darling?&mdash;that
I have not known you since the moment we met again?
That senseless marble lies when it says my wife is dead! You are
she, you are Laurel Le Roy!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVI" id="CHAPTER_LVI">CHAPTER LVI.</a></h2>


<p>There was a moment of the most utter silence while St. Leon Le
Roy's wild, appealing words died upon the stillness of the solemn
place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynn was struck dumb for an instant by the suddenness and
passion of her husband's accusation. She grew ghastly pale&mdash;she
trembled like a wind-blown leaf, the denial she would have uttered
died gaspingly upon her quivering lips.</p>

<p>"You are my wife," he repeated. "There was never but one
face, one voice in this world like yours, and they belonged to
Laurel Vane. My darling, you will not deny the truth! You did
not throw yourself into the dark, cruel river that summer night.
You went away and hid yourself from me in the wide world. It
was some unknown waif whom we buried in this shaft for you, my
own sweet one! That marble cross speaks falsely. Thank God you
live, Laurel, to hear the story of my sorrow and repentance! You
cannot, you will not, refuse to forgive me!"</p>

<p>She sprung from her seat as he advanced, and slowly retreated
before him, her eyes wide and dark with terror; she put out her
white hands before her as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>"You are mad!" she cried, hoarsely. "You are simply mad,
Mr. Le Roy! Your great sorrow has unhinged your brain. Come
away from this gloomy place of graves into the world again, and I
will try to forget your momentary madness!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to deny the truth?" he cried, gazing reproachfully
at the beautiful, defiant face. "Is it right to scorn me,
Laurel, when I have so bitterly repented the wrong I did you? Is
it right to defraud me of my child's love&mdash;right to defraud the child
of his father's love? Do you think I do not know that your beautiful
little Laurence is my own child? Shall I tell you why my mother
fainted in your rose garden that day? She lifted the boy's dark,
clustering locks from his temples and saw the familiar Le Roy
birth-mark&mdash;the crimson heart that you, my wife, have so often
kissed on my temple. I saw her, although I made no sign. Laurel,
you will give me my son? You will come home to Eden yourself,
forgetting and forgiving all the past, will you not, my injured wife?
I will atone for my momentary hardness by the devotion of a lifetime!"</p>

<p>He held out his arms yearningly to the beautiful, startled woman
standing dumbly before him with a smile of scorn on her perfect
lips. She was terribly frightened when she found that he had recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
her, but she had no thought of confessing the truth. All the
hard, bitter pride that had grown up in her heart these eight years
was at war with her husband's claim. She held her hands out before
her as if to ward him off as he came nearer to her side.</p>

<p>"I can only say, as I did just now, that you are mad," she said.
"I can excuse you because I know that your brain must be turned
by your sorrow. But this must go no further. I will not endure
it. There are limits that even my patience will not suffer to be
passed. I am nothing to you, St. Leon Le Roy&mdash;nothing! As for
the child, you have deceived yourself. It is the scar of a wound on
the child's temple, not a birth-mark as you think."</p>

<p>He stared at her like one dazed, his arms dropping weakly at his
sides. That she would refuse to forgive him he had expected and
dreaded, but that she would deny her identity when taxed with it,
had not occurred to him. It put quite a new phase upon the matter.
She had not staggered his convictions in the least, but she
had shown him what ground both stood upon. He was powerless,
helpless. There was nothing for him but to bow to her will.</p>

<p>"You deny my charges?" he said. "You cut the ground from
under my feet and leave me without a hope&mdash;with nothing but this
grave?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, pale as death, beautiful, proud, defiant.
"I forgive you for your brief madness. We will never recur to it
again. Now, will you take me home?"</p>

<p>"In a moment," he answered. He was busy plucking some
flowers from the grave. He held them out to her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynn, will you take these flowers?" he said. "Take them
and keep them. They may remind you sometimes of all that is
buried in this grave for me&mdash;love, hope, happiness."</p>

<p>She took them silently, and they went away from that place of
tombs into the busy, beautiful world again. They spoke but little
driving home, and then only on indifferent subjects&mdash;never on the
theme lying deep in their hearts&mdash;the love, the remorse, the unsatisfied
longing, the fruitless pain of their lives.</p>

<p>But Laurel, when she had reached her own private room, threw
herself down upon the floor with a great, tearless sob of utter
agony.</p>

<p>"Oh, how cruel I am," she cried. "For the sake of my miserable
pride, I have murdered my own last chance of happiness!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVII" id="CHAPTER_LVII">CHAPTER LVII.</a></h2>


<p>It was a long while before Laurel recovered her calmness. She
had been severely shaken by her interview with Mr. Le Roy. She
did not feel half so triumphant and victorious as she might have
done. She had repulsed her husband, she had made him suffer all
that she had suffered that night when he had renounced her. But
there was none of the sweetness of victory in her triumph. She was
at war with herself. Her own heart was a traitor. It only ached
over the conquest of love by ruthless pride. The triumph was bitterer
than defeat.</p>

<p>When she dragged herself up from the floor at last, with all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
misery written on her face, she saw a letter lying on her toilet-table.
It had been brought in by her maid during her absence. She took
it up, and found that it was addressed to herself, in the delicate,
refined hand of Mrs. Le Roy.</p>

<p>An expression of dismay and dread came over the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"Why has she written to me?" she asked herself. "Does she,
too, mean to claim me and Laurie?"</p>

<p>She grew very pale at the thought. A dread came over her that
they would take her child from her to punish her for her willfulness
and pride.</p>

<p>"They shall not have him," she said to herself, setting her little
white teeth firmly together. "I will take my little son and fly to
the uttermost ends of the earth with him. I was foolish and weak
even to have come here. I forgot many things I ought to have
remembered. I forgot utterly that tell-tale birth mark on my
child's temple&mdash;the birth-mark of all the Le Roys. I never dreamed
that they would suspect me. I thought that grave with my name
upon it was an all sufficient shield for me."</p>

<p>She opened the letter and read it. It was a beautiful, pathetic appeal
that brought tears to Laurel's proud, dark eyes. Mrs. Le Roy
had recognized her, too. She prayed her to forgive St. Leon for his
hardness of heart, and to return to him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not know whether my son has recognized you or not, Laurel,"
wrote the anxious mother. "You may remember that he is
very proud and reserved. He is silent. He makes no sign. And
yet I think that he could not have failed to know you. Forgive
him, Laurel. He has suffered bitterly and repented sorely. Let me
tell him that you are living, and that your beautiful little son is his
own child. Let me tell him that you both will come home to us.
Ah, Laurel, my dear daughter, I cannot tell you how tenderly my
heart goes out to you, both for your own sake and for that of the
child. How I love the beautiful, manly little lad! He is the heir
to Eden, the last descendant of the Le Roys, my son's son, my only
grandchild. All these years you have kept him from us; you have
had all his sweetness to yourself. I have no word of blame for you,
my dear daughter. I know you were greatly wronged&mdash;almost
driven, as it were, into the course you adopted. But you will give
him to us now, will you not, dear? You will come back to the
home you never should have left, you will be the light of our hearts
and our eyes, as you were before that fatal night. To-morrow I
shall come to you for your answer. I have not told St. Leon of my
discovery. I shall not speak to him until after I see you. But I
cannot help but hope, that your answer will be a favorable one.
You would not have come here among us if you had not meant to
be kind to us. I remember your gentle, loving heart, my dear, and,
although you have the world at your feet now, I think you will be
the same tender, loving little girl that you were of old. You will
come home to us soon&mdash;you and my darling little Laurence."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Laurence, Laurence, it is only of the child they think&mdash;only of
their heir to Eden," she said to herself, bitterly. "I see through it
all. They would endure the mother for the child's sake! I understand!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
But it shall not be. I will take my boy away. I have cared
for him all these years, and I will do so still. They who were so
cruel to the mother shall have none of the child's love!"</p>

<p>And when Mrs. Le Roy called the next day she was astounded to
find that Carlyle Ford and Mrs. Lynn and her son had left Belle
Vue the previous evening. None of the servants were aware of their
destination. One of them gave the lady a note that Mrs. Lynn had
left behind for her. It was brief and cruelly cold.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I regret that I cannot have the honor of receiving you, as we
are leaving suddenly and for an indefinite time," wrote Mrs. Lynn.
"I must say that your letter was all Greek to me. You seem laboring
under some strange hallucination of the brain. I fear you are
threatened with a brain fever. I would advise you to consult a physician.
Delays are dangerous in such cases."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Le Roy went home like one dazed. She had not counted on
such a terrible disappointment. She had staked everything on Laurel's
sweet, forgiving disposition. She had made no allowance for a
woman's pride.</p>

<p>She went to the library, where St. Leon sat among his books&mdash;dreaming,
not reading&mdash;dreaming of a fair, cold, scornful face that
shone on him from the walls of memory&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Passionless, pale, cold face, star-sweet on a gloom profound;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Woman-like, taking revenge too deep for a transient wrong."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He glanced up absently at his mother's entrance, too absorbed in
his own thoughts to notice her irrepressible agitation.</p>

<p>"Oh, St. Leon," she cried out, distressfully. "Mrs. Lynn has
gone away!"</p>

<p>She saw the handsome face whiten under its healthy brown. He
did not speak for a moment, only put out his hand and drew her
gently to him. Then he said, in a hoarse, strained voice:</p>

<p>"Well, mother?"</p>

<p>The tone told her more than words. She broke out, vehemently:</p>

<p>"My son, did you know, did you understand? It was Laurel,
your wife, it was your own child. Can you realize it, my son?"</p>

<p>He answered, wearily:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, dear."</p>

<p>"You knew, and you let her go without a word&mdash;oh, St. Leon,"
she exclaimed, reproachfully.</p>

<p>The dark mustached lips parted in a slight sad smile.</p>

<p>"You wrong me, mother," he said: "I spoke to her. I claimed
her and the child. She denied her identity, she laughed me to scorn.
There was nothing more for me to say or do."</p>

<p>"You give her up like this&mdash;her and the heir to Eden?" she exclaimed,
in dismay.</p>

<p>"There is nothing else to do&mdash;she denies my claim, and that ends
all. I make no war upon women," he answered, sadly, but firmly.</p>

<p>Tears of bitter disappointment crowded to her eyes. She had so
counted upon this reconciliation, so longed to have Laurel back&mdash;Laurel
and the little child who was heir to Eden.</p>

<p>"And the child&mdash;will you give him up without a word?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
asked, in bitter disappointment. "You have every legal right to
him."</p>

<p>"Granted&mdash;but do you think I could take him from Laurel? No,
no, mother, she shall keep the little one. We will not disturb her. It
may be some little atonement for that night, if we leave her in
peace;" then, with a weary sigh, "Let us drop the subject,
mother."</p>

<p>Sorely disappointed, she acquiesced in his decision, knowing that
there was no appeal from his firm will.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVIII" id="CHAPTER_LVIII">CHAPTER LVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Laurel had left Belle Vue in a sudden panic of fear and dread.
She was afraid that her bold denial of her identity would irritate
the Le Roys into an attempt to prove their charges and claim her
child. She determined to put a wide distance between herself and
her husband, regretting in her new-born terror that she had ever exposed
herself to the danger of being recognized by him.</p>

<p>She did not confide to her uncle the fact that she had been
charged with her identity by her husband and his mother. She
knew that Mr. Ford sympathized with the Le Roys in their repentance
and sorrow, and she knew what his advice would be. She
had not confided to him the reason of her sudden flitting. She
knew that he was the loving slave of her imperious will, and that
she need but express a wish to have it gratified. So the grand home
on the Hudson was deserted, and they sought "fresh fields and pastures
new," according to Laurel's capricious fancy. If Mr. Ford
wondered at her fickleness, he kept it to himself. Perhaps he was
not altogether sorry that Laurel was not to leave him yet. His heartstrings
were very closely entwined around her and her beautiful
child. He would have been lonely indeed without them.</p>

<p>They went to a noted summer resort by the seashore, and Laurel
declared that she meant to labor diligently here on a new book she
had commenced to write that summer. But the new novel did not
grow very fast. The brilliant author was restless and ill at ease.
Some days she would devote to her task with a feverish energy and
persistence, often writing far into the night. Again there would be
days and days when the manuscript remained locked in her desk
neglected and untouched, while Laurel threw herself into the whirl
of social pleasure with a zest born of the desire to forget. But neither
in work nor pleasure did she find that lethean draught for which
her lips thirsted. She was haunted by a voice, a face. She could
not choose but remember.</p>

<p>Even if it had been possible for her to forget, little Laurence
would not have allowed her to do so. Strange to say, the child had
taken a wondrous fancy to the Le Roys, both mother and son. He
prattled of them often in his pretty childish fashion, regretting that
he could not see them again, and every word was like a dagger in
the mother's heart. She knew that it was nature and instinct clamoring
for its own in the boy's heart. Sometimes she was almost
melted, sometimes she felt keenly the wrong she had done the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in depriving him of his father's love. But her hard, bitter pride
was always stronger than her pity and her love.</p>

<p>Little Laurence found a congenial playmate at last, and his regrets
for Belle Vue and Eden grew daily less and less. It was a little
golden-haired girl of six years old, called Trixy by her nurse,
who brought her to play on the sands daily with her little toy spade
and bucket. In Laurie's shell-gathering expeditions with his own
nurse, the two children became acquainted and were soon inseparable
companions and friends. Laurence did not rest until he had
made his mother acquainted with the little beauty.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand my feelings when I look at little Trixy,"
Mrs. Lynn said to her uncle, with a pretty, puzzled air. "The
child's face haunts me. In some inexplicable manner she recalls the
past. And yet I cannot remember whom she is like."</p>

<p>She was not fated to remain long in ignorance of the resemblance
that haunted her so strangely.</p>

<p>She was standing on the shore one day looking dreamily out at
the swelling, foam-capped waves, as they rolled in and broke in
crystal spray at her feet, when she was startled by little Trixy's
voice, crying vivaciously:</p>

<p>"Oh, Laurie, here comes mamma! Now she can see <i>your</i> mamma,
Laurie!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lynn turned toward the children, and saw a fair, blue eyed
woman coming up to them. She gazed in silence a moment, then
gave a great strangling gasp of surprise and recognition. It was
Beatrix Wentworth!</p>

<p>The past rushed bleakly over Laurel's memory; the past, with all
its love and sorrow and shame. The sight of this fair woman
brought it all back freshly and with terrible realism. She stood
like one turned to stone, as Mrs. Wentworth came up to her, a look
of startled wonder on her lovely blonde face.</p>

<p>"Laurel Vane!" she cried, and put out both her hands.</p>

<p>Laurel drew back coldly, all her self-possession returning.</p>

<p>"You have made a mistake," she said; "I am Mrs. Lynn!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wentworth colored deeply.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;you are right," she said. "I was so startled
by your likeness to my friend that I forgot for the moment that she
by whose name I called you is long since numbered with the dead!"</p>

<p>"I regret to have awakened unpleasant emotions in your mind,"
said Laurel, gently, as she offered her card to Mrs. Wentworth.</p>

<p>"You are little Trixy's mother," she went on, smiling. "I am
very glad to know you for her sake. She and my little son are great
friends."</p>

<p>"You have a son?" said Mrs. Wentworth, as she exchanged
cards with Laurel. She sighed heavily, and then Laurel noticed that
she wore a black dress. "Ah, I had a son, too, Mrs. Lynn, a beautiful
boy that would be as old now as yours had he lived, but he
lies buried in an English graveyard."</p>

<p>"You are English?" asked Laurel, gently, her heart melting in
sympathy with the tear that sparkled down Beatrix's cheek.</p>

<p>"No, I am American, but I have lived in England ever since my
marriage, nine years ago. Little Trixy was born in London, as also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
my little Cyril, dead three years ago. We have come home now to
live."</p>

<p>"We?" said Mrs. Lynn, with a slight, interrogative accent on
the pronoun.</p>

<p>"I should have said Mr. Wentworth and myself, and Trixy.
There are only three of us," explained Beatrix, pensively, and
smothering a sigh.</p>

<p>Laurel wondered to herself whether the Gordons had ever forgiven
their daughter; she wondered what had become of smart, pretty
Clarice Wells. But she could not ask any of these questions that
filled her thoughts, because she had decided that she, in her own
proper identity, would remain as dead to Mrs. Wentworth as she
was to the rest of the world. They stood there side by side, the two
fair women who had so greatly influenced each other's lives, and
gazed pensively at the sun-gilded waves, trying to put away the
thoughts of the past that each recalled to the other, and to recall
themselves to the present.</p>

<p>"I have read your books, Mrs. Lynn," said Beatrix. "I think
they are among the most beautiful in the language. I am proud of
you as an American author."</p>

<p>"You praise my poor efforts too highly," Laurel said, with her
slow, half-sad smile.</p>

<p>"I do not think so. The critics agree with me at least," said
Beatrix. "Do you not find it very pleasant to be laurel crowned,
Mrs. Lynn&mdash;to win the applause of the world and own a name that
will live beyond the grave?"</p>

<p>"To be</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"'Conscious that a world's regret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would seek us where we lie!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Mrs. Lynn, with a slight, sad smile. "Ah, Mrs. Wentworth,
will you believe that I have scarcely ever regarded the subject
from that point of view? When I first took up literary work it
was to win bread for my little child. Since success has crowned my
efforts, since hard necessity drives me no longer, I labor on because
I have need to fill an empty void in my life. From first to last I
have had no thought of fame."</p>

<p>The soft sigh of the waves blending with her voice made it sound
very sad. Mrs. Wentworth looked at the beautiful, proud face
curiously. Some kind of a history was written on it. There was a
lingering shadow in the somber, dark eyes, a sorrowful gravity
about the lovely crimson lips. She wondered what that empty void
might be. And then she remembered that she had heard that Mrs.
Lynn was a widow.</p>

<p>"It is grief for her husband," said Beatrix to herself.</p>

<p>"I suppose we all have something in our lives that we are glad to
forget in the oblivion of hard work, or even in the pursuit of pleasure,"
she said. "My little Cyril's death left an aching void in my
own heart, and I have another sorrow too. I have been a disobedient
child to my parents. I never fully appreciated the enormity of
my unpardonable fault until I had a little daughter of my own."</p>

<p>Beatrix spoke in a tone of dreamy sadness. She did not seem to
be speaking to a stranger, but rather to a friend. The subtle likeness
between Mrs. Lynn and Laurel Vane affected her strangely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Laurel caught at her words quickly.</p>

<p>"Your unpardoned fault," she echoed. "Do you mean to say
that your parents never forgave your disobedience, Mrs. Wentworth?"</p>

<p>"Never," Beatrix answered, with a sigh that showed how deep
her pain lay.</p>

<p>Then they were silent for a time. The idle loiterers on the beach,
the casual passers by turned twice to look at the two fair women, so
beautiful, so unlike in their beauty&mdash;Beatrix so lily-fair with her
large blue eyes and pale-gold tresses; Laurel with her rare, unusual
type of beauty, her dark eyes, her blonde skin, her burnished hair;
the one in her dress of deep, lusterless black silk, the other in something
white and soft and clinging, marvelously becoming to her
graceful style.</p>

<p>"Shall you be long at the seaside?" Laurel inquired, presently.</p>

<p>"A few weeks&mdash;that is all," Beatrix replied. "Mr. Wentworth
is in New York&mdash;business, you know, Mrs. Lynn&mdash;Trixy and I cannot
stay long away from him."</p>

<p>"You are fond of him?" said Laurel, turning her large, wistful
eyes on the other's tender face.</p>

<p>The tenderness deepened in Mrs. Wentworth's sweet blue eyes,
and around her gentle lips.</p>

<p>"You would think so if you knew the story of our marriage,"
she said. "Ours was a real love-match, Mrs. Lynn. It was most
romantic. Some day, when I know you better I will tell it to you.
It would furnish you a plot for a novel."</p>

<p>Laurel turned her head aside and set her lips in a tense, hard line.
She remembered how the story had been told her a few weeks ago
in that green city of the dead beside the grave where the unknown
waif lay under the name of Laurel Le Roy.</p>

<p>"God forbid that I should have to hear the story told again," she
murmured to herself.</p>

<p>She looked back at Mrs. Wentworth and said, calmly, and even
smilingly:</p>

<p>"It is very pleasant to hear of a real love-match in real life. I
suppose you are very happy, Mrs. Wentworth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very happy with my noble husband," Beatrix said,
thoughtfully. "But my happiness was purchased at a bitter cost
to another. I know what it is to feel the sharp sting of remorse,
Mrs. Lynn."</p>

<p>Little Trixy came up with a beautiful shell and claimed her
mother's attention. They went away together presently, and left
Laurel to her own reflections. They were very sweet and noble
ones. She was thinking of the Gordons&mdash;longing to reconcile them
to their daughter and her husband.</p>

<p>"I am glad that she is happy with her husband," mused Laurel.
"Oh, how differently our girlish conspiracy resulted for her and for
me. And yet&mdash;would I change places with her? No, hers be the
pleasure, mine the pain."</p>

<p>She walked slowly back to the hotel, leaving Laurie at play with
his nurse on the shell-strewn beach. In the hotel corridor she encountered
some new arrivals, ladies and gentlemen, going to their
rooms. Quite oblivious of their interested, admiring stare, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
passed on, and took no note of the pretty, painted blonde face that
whitened beneath all her rouge as she stared aghast, and murmured,
huskily:</p>

<p>"Is it Laurel Vane or her ghost? I never saw such a terrible likeness!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIX" id="CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX.</a></h2>


<p>Was it chance or fate that brought Mr. Gordon down, a few
weeks later, to consult with Mrs. Lynn about the publication of her
new book?</p>

<p>She was down on the shore with her little Laurence and his playmate,
Trixy Wentworth. The little girl's mother had promised to
join her presently. She and Mrs. Lynn had become quite intimate
friends by this time. They were fond of each other, as two young,
pretty, noble women like Beatrix and Laurel are apt to be when
thrown together. Beatrix had told all her romantic story to Mrs.
Lynn, and Laurel had heard it silently, and made no sign. She said
to herself that that unhappy girl, over whose fate Beatrix drowned
her blue eyes in regretful tears, must remain as one dead to all the
world. She would not confess her secret. She would remain Mrs.
Lynn to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>She sat still on her low camp-chair, with her large parasol held
open over her head, and waited for Beatrix to come. She had a
book open in her lap, but she was not reading. Her large, dark,
thoughtful eyes wandered from the pretty children at play with their
attentive nurses, to the billowy foam capped waves rolling in to her
feet with a hollow, mystical murmur full of woe and mystery.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon came out to her there, and he was puzzled, as he
always was, when he saw Mrs. Lynn, by her subtle likeness to some
one he had seen or known, and whom he could not now recall.</p>

<p>"Have I ever told you how strangely you affect me, Mrs. Lynn?"
he said. "You are like some one I have known whom I cannot
now recall. If I could bring myself to believe in theories I have
heard advanced, I should say I had known you in some other previous
world."</p>

<p>She knew where he had seen her. It was at Eden that fatal night
that had struck her down from happiness to the keenest despair.
Her face grew pale, her limbs trembled beneath her.</p>

<p>"Some day the truth will break upon him with the suddenness of
the lightning's flash. He will recognize me as Laurel Vane, the girl
he refused to forgive and pity that fatal night. He will know that
the scorn of proud, rich people did not quite crush me, that I survived
it all," she said to herself with the pride that had become a
part of her nature.</p>

<p>But she did not mean that he should recognize her if she could
help it. Certainly she would never own the truth even if he taxed
her with it: so she answered with a careless smile:</p>

<p>"The world is full of chance resemblances that puzzle and amaze
us, Mr. Gordon. You see that little girl playing with my son there?
Well, when I first saw her I had the oddest fancy that she was like
some one I had seen or known. The likeness was haunting and
troublesome at first, but I have grown used to it now. It does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
trouble me any longer. Do look at her, Mr. Gordon. Is she not a
lovely child?"</p>

<p>He looked, and a sudden cry of wonder came from his lips. The
years rolled backward, and in the face of little Trixy he seemed to
see his own Beatrix in her tender childhood&mdash;his beautiful, beloved
daughter, who had been so willful and disobedient, and to whose sin
he had refused his forgiveness.</p>

<p>"She is like some one I have known, too. Ah, so like, so like!"
he said, in a strange voice. "Who is she, Miss Lynn?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Trixy Wentworth, Mr. Gordon. She is an American
child, but she was born in England. Her parents lived there
nearly nine years. They have come back to New York to live now.
Mr. Cyril Wentworth is in business there. Trixy is here with her
mother for her health."</p>

<p>He stifled something like a groan upon his lips. Laurel saw how
pale he had suddenly grown, and followed up her advantage by
calling the little one to her and setting her on Mr. Gordon's knee.</p>

<p>"Give the gentleman a kiss, Trixy," she said to the lovely little
golden-haired creature. "He is very lonely; he has no little girl of
his own."</p>

<p>Trixy's ready sympathies were instantly enlisted by that, to her
mind, pathetic statement. She gave Mr. Gordon a fastidious look-you-over
stare, and, seeing that he was pleasant to look upon, put
her round, dimpled arms about his neck and gave him a bear-like
hug and a resounding kiss.</p>

<p>"Is it true that you really have no little girl?" she asked him,
bending back her pretty head to look into his face with eyes that
pierced his heart with their likeness to Beatrix&mdash;Beatrix, his little
girl whom he had put away from his heart, hated and unforgiven,
because she had disobeyed him.</p>

<p>He could not speak for a moment, and Mrs. Lynn said, gently,
looking away at the restless sea the while:</p>

<p>"This little girl has a grandpapa in New York, Mr. Gordon, who
has never seen her. Her mother made a marriage that displeased
him, and he has never forgiven her. He has missed a world of love
by his hardness and sternness&mdash;do you not think so?"</p>

<p>The dark-eyed little Laurence came running up before he could
frame a reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Trixy, you shouldn't be sitting on that gentleman's
lap, you know," he exclaimed, "for you have promised to be my
little wife!"</p>

<p>This childish jealousy provoked such a laugh from the elders, that
it quite drowned the sound of a light, quick step that came up behind
them. In a moment more Beatrix Wentworth came around in
front of the group.</p>

<p>The smile died on her lips, as she saw her little daughter sitting
on the lap of the stern father she had not beheld for more than nine
years. Poor Beatrix looked frightened and dismayed. The pretty
rose-tint faded from her face, her lips trembled, and the words she
strove to utter died silently upon them.</p>

<p>Laurel rose with an encouraging smile and drew her friend forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Gordon," she said, "this is my friend, Mrs. Wentworth.
She is little Trixy's mother."</p>

<p>Beatrix looked upon into the face of her father through blinding
tears and put out her hand.</p>

<p>"Papa, forgive me," she murmured, sadly.</p>

<p>There was a moment's dead silence. Mr. Gordon had put the
child from his knee and risen, but he did not answer his daughter.
She went on, in gentle, pleading tones.</p>

<p>"Papa, I have written to you so often and begged you to forgive
me, and every time my letters came back to me unopened. Papa, I
cannot say I am sorry for my fault, because Cyril is good and kind,
and he makes me very happy. But I have grieved sorely for you
and mamma, I have longed to be reconciled to you. Oh, surely you
will not refuse to forgive me now that we are face to face!"</p>

<p>"Forgive her, Mr. Gordon," cried Laurel, impulsively.</p>

<p>The two fair faces, the pleading voices, the wondering eyes of the
little children, were too much for Mr. Gordon's calmness. His
pride and sternness melted into love and remorse. Laurel gave one
glance at his quivering face and turned gently away. She knew
that the end was won&mdash;that love had conquered pride. He would
forgive Beatrix.</p>

<p>But she did not know that in this moment when the ice melted
around his hard, cold heart and he forgave his disobedient daughter,
new light had broken upon his mind. The sight of Beatrix had
supplied the missing link that connected Mrs. Lynn so subtly with
his past. Like a flash of lightning it dawned upon him that this
was Laurel Vane.</p>

<p>That night at Eden rushed over his mind, freshly as though it
were but yesterday. He saw again the beautiful impostor who had
personated his own daughter and married the master of Eden.</p>

<p>While he gave Beatrix the tender embrace of forgiveness, he
seemed to see in fancy the kneeling, suppliant girl to whom he had
refused his forgiveness, whom no one had pitied, whom all had forsaken
and ignored. Even in his anger that night he had been struck
by the wondrous beauty of the girl. This was the same lovely face,
with its charm only intensified by time; this was the same sweet
voice asking him to pardon Beatrix that had begged forgiveness
vainly for herself. He was full of wonder over his sudden discovery.</p>

<p>"They said that Le Roy's wife drowned herself, but it cannot be
true. There is some terrible mistake, some unexplained mystery.
This is Louis Vane's daughter, and she has inherited all the genius
of her erratic father," he said to himself.</p>

<p>He did not know what to do. He was frightened at his own discovery.
He wondered if Beatrix knew the truth. He inclined to
believe that she did, but when he found an opportunity and questioned
her he was rather staggered to find that Mrs. Lynn had resolutely
denied her identity with Laurel Vane.</p>

<p>"I do not believe her. She is St. Leon Le Roy's wife, and the
child is his. It bears its paternity on its face. What is your opinion,
Beatrix?" asked the great publisher, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I believe that you are right," she replied; "I have believed that
she was Mr. Le Roy's wife ever since I first met her several weeks
ago. Her assertions to the contrary had no weight with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
although I held my peace and respected her reserve. I have been
silent, but I have not been convinced."</p>

<p>"What is her object in this strange denial of herself?" he asked,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Pride and wounded feeling," Beatrix answered, with the unerring
instinct of a woman.</p>

<p>When he remembered that night long years ago he did not blame
her much. They had scorned and flouted her cruelly among them&mdash;they
had no pity on the erring girl&mdash;they had driven her to desperation,
forgetting how young and friendless she had been. He
wondered much what had been the history of the intervening years,
and how she had come by her name of Mrs. Lynn.</p>

<p>"Only her <i>nom de plume</i>, perhaps," he thought; and then he said,
aloud: "Beatrix, do you not think I ought to write to St. Leon Le
Roy to come down here?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be perfectly proper," she replied.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LX" id="CHAPTER_LX">CHAPTER LX.</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Wentworth and Mr. Gordon were not the only persons at
the seaside who suspected that Mrs. Lynn was other than she
seemed.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the pretty, faded widow, Mrs. Merivale, had
been aroused by the first sight of Mrs. Lynn. She spared no pains
until she obtained an introduction to the noted writer, over whose
charms of mind and person all the best people at the seaside were
enthusiastic in admiration. When she had done so, she was almost
frightened by the astonishing likeness of Mrs. Lynn to Laurel Vane.</p>

<p>"It is the dead alive!" she said to herself. "I can no longer believe
that St. Leon's wife drowned herself. There has been some
great mistake. She went away and hid herself from all who knew
her, and she has reappeared as Mrs. Lynn. I wish I knew the history
of those intervening years, and what she intends to do. Will
she return to St. Leon? Will he forgive her and take her back?"</p>

<p>She was bitterly chagrined and angry at the thought that Laurel
lived in the person of the beautiful, gifted, wealthy Mrs. Lynn.
She had been glad when she heard that Laurel was dead. She began
to feel now that Fate had played her an unkind trick in resurrecting
her hated rival from the grave, where she had deemed her resting
all these long years; not that the wily widow had any hope of winning
St. Leon. She had understood that long ago. She knew that
he was proof against her faded charms, her rouged and powdered
beauty, that he thoroughly despised her. She had known it ever
since that night at Eden, when he had flung back her offered heart
on her hands in supremest scorn and sarcasm. The knowledge had
aroused all the littleness and spite of her malicious nature. She had
hated St. Leon from that moment&mdash;hated the beautiful girl who had
won him even more. She would gladly have done both an ill turn
if she could, but Laurel, dead in her grave, was secure from her
vengeance, and St. Leon, in his proud position and calm reserve,
beyond her reach. For several years she had not seen him, but she
knew that he had returned from his wanderings and was at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
again. The thought that Laurel still lived, the bare possibility that
she might yet be reunited to her husband, filled her with jealous
anger and dread. On the spur of the moment she penned a letter
to one who hated St. Leon and Laurel with as deadly a rancor as
her own&mdash;one whose love for Laurel had changed to hate, even as
had Mrs. Merivale's for St. Leon&mdash;no less a person than the villain,
Ross Powell.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell's animosity against the rich man who had won Laurel
had not been lessened by the fact that Mr. Le Roy had secured the
dismissal of the villain from Mr. Gordon's employ in the week immediately
following the <i>exposé</i> at Eden. Mr. Le Roy's resentment
had followed him steadily from one place to another in New York,
until he found that it was useless to expect to retain employment in
that city, and was forced to seek a livelihood in a more distant one
beyond the reach of his enemy's anger.</p>

<p>The villain was well punished for his unmanly persecution of an
innocent, helpless girl, but it did not add to the sweetness of his temper
to receive this merited retribution for his wickedness. He swore
revenge upon St. Leon Le Roy, and patiently bided his time, pledging
himself the faithful ally of Mrs. Merivale in her hatred of her
whilom friend and lover.</p>

<p>The time for his revenge seemed come at last, when he received
Mrs. Merivale's letter, urging him to come to the seaside, and help
her to identify Laurel Vane in the beautiful, courted woman queening
it so royally in circles where Maud Merivale could barely find a
footing. He lost no time in obeying her mandate, feeling as anxious
as the wicked widow herself to prevent a reunion of the long-separated
husband and wife.</p>

<p>He reached the hotel on a lovely evening in the last of August,
and was shown at once to Mrs. Merivale's private parlor. They had
never met but once before, but there was no embarrassment in the
meeting. Both were alike at heart&mdash;crafty, evil, unscrupulous&mdash;ready
to do their best to dash down the possible cup of happiness
from the lips of the man and woman they hated with all the venom
of their little souls.</p>

<p>"And you are sure that she is Laurel Vane?" he said, in wonder.</p>

<p>"I am sure&mdash;quite sure in my own mind," she replied. "But you
will see her very probably this evening at the usual hop if she
deigns to honor it with her presence. It is not often she appears,
being very exclusive and reserved, but if you miss her to-night you
will be very sure to see her on the shore in the morning."</p>

<p>"What are we to do if it be really Laurel Vane?" asked Powell,
musingly.</p>

<p>Her pale eyes flashed with subtle meaning.</p>

<p>"We must do anything to prevent her from meeting Mr. Le Roy
again&mdash;I could not endure their happiness," she replied, bitterly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXI" id="CHAPTER_LXI">CHAPTER LXI.</a></h2>


<p>Contrary to her usual habit, and to humor a caprice of Mrs.
Wentworth's, Laurel decided to make her appearance in the hotel
parlors that evening. Beatrix and her child were going back to
New York with Mr. Gordon the next day. He had promised his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
daughter to take her home to her mother&mdash;promised her Mrs. Gordon's
free and full forgiveness both for herself and her beloved
Cyril. Beatrix was very happy in the reconciliation with her father&mdash;so
happy that Laurel could not bear to cloud the brightness of her
sky with a single shadow, so she did not refuse when Beatrix asked
her to go into the parlors with her that evening.</p>

<p>"Papa wishes it," said Mrs. Wentworth, "and Cyril is coming,
too. He has read your books, and he is very anxious to see you.
He can scarcely credit my written statement that you are so
young still, in spite of your brilliant literary fame. He imagines
you an old lady in cap and spectacles."</p>

<p>Laurel laughed and promised to be introduced to Mr. Wentworth.
She had a vivid remembrance of the fair, handsome young fellow
who had been so kind and pitiful to her that day in London, when
Beatrix and Clarice had so scolded and frightened her. She felt
grateful to him still, and was not averse to seeing him again, herself
unknown.</p>

<p>She chose an evening dress of pale-pink brocade, with cream-white
Spanish lace. The rainbow fire of opals shone on her arms and
neck, and her beautiful burnished golden hair was arranged on the
top of her head in a queenly fashion. Though she had scarcely
given a thought to her personal appearance, she had never looked
more lovely. There was not a single woman at the seaside that night
who could at all compare with Mrs. Lynn for grace and beauty.</p>

<p>Some one else besides Ross Powell had arrived that evening&mdash;no
less a person than St. Leon Le Roy.</p>

<p>He was rather puzzled to know why Mr. Gordon had sent him
that mysterious summons; but when they met, and he frankly inquired
the reason, he received an evasive reply. Mr. Gordon promised
to tell him after awhile, but just now he had promised to escort
his daughter, Mrs. Wentworth, into the ball-room, where the lively
strains of the band were already in progress.</p>

<p>Would Mr. Le Roy see Beatrix and forgive her for her share in
his past trouble? She was so sorry, so ashamed. She had never
dreamed how it would all turn out.</p>

<p>The publisher was a little nervous as he thus pleaded for his
daughter. She had told her father the story of her unanswered letter
to Mr. Le Roy. He could not tell whether time had softened his
resentment at the girl's conspiracy that had ended so disastrously.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy grew very pale for a moment as he was thus brought
face to face with the past. Then he remembered Mrs. Wentworth's
letter with something like shame. It had been so kind, and sweet,
and womanly&mdash;so truly repentant.</p>

<p>"I was rude and churlish to slight it so," he said to himself, remorsefully.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to see her, and I hope she will forgive me
for my churlishness," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon conducted him to his daughter's private parlor.
Beatrix was there, looking very lovely in a simple evening-dress of
black and white. Tears crowded thickly to her azure eyes as she
confessed her fault and begged him to pardon her.</p>

<p>"If I had known that you were at Eden, Mr. Le Roy, I should
never have sent poor little Laurel there," said Beatrix. "I was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
young and silly girl enough, I own, but I should have been too wise
to have sent that lovely, ignorant child into the way of temptation."</p>

<p>"That lovely, ignorant child!"&mdash;somehow those words seemed
like a tacit reproach to him. Yes, that was what she had been&mdash;a
beautiful, simple child, all unversed in the world's ways, ignorant
of the enormity of her fault, or believing that her great love condoned
it. How hardly, how cruelly he had judged her, the girl-wife
he had taken before God, "for better, for worse."</p>

<p>"I have not kept my vow," he said to himself, and Beatrix, who
thought him hard and stern, wondered at the softness of his voice as
he replied:</p>

<p>"I forgive you freely, Mrs. Wentworth, and, indeed, I sometimes
wonder if there is anything to forgive. My wife made me very
happy. I erred when in my hardness I refused to forgive her.
But for my hard, suspicious nature that made me impute mercenary
motives to her, I should have pardoned the child's fault. But I was
cruelly hard. It is no wonder she refuses to forgive me."</p>

<p>"Refuses!" Beatrix echoed, with a start of wonder, as she gazed
into his pale, agitated face.</p>

<p>"I spoke in the present tense, as if Laurel really existed. A
mere slip of the tongue, Mrs. Wentworth," he said, with assumed
carelessness.</p>

<p>"Ah! if only he knew the real truth! But I can see that he is
deeply repentant, and I foresee a joyful reconciliation between him
and his beautiful gifted wife," said Beatrix to herself, hopefully.</p>

<p>In a little while Cyril Wentworth came in. It was but a distant
greeting the two gentlemen gave each other. Cyril thought that Mr.
Le Roy had treated his erring bride hardly and unjustly, and he
could not be cordial to him, for pretty Laurel's sake&mdash;and on the
other hand St. Leon remembered how jealous he had been of this
handsome young man in the days before he learned the truth about
his wife. The old dislike and resentment lingered with him unconsciously
still. He took leave very soon after Cyril's entrance, promising
to meet them later in the ball-room or the parlors.</p>

<p>"Now, I am going to introduce you to Mrs. Lynn," said Beatrix
to her husband. "You will escort her to the ball-room, and papa
will take me."</p>

<p>She led him to Laurel's apartment, and watched him closely as he
bowed before the gifted authoress whose writings he admired so
much. Cyril was almost dumb with surprise and admiration. It
was some time before he recovered himself sufficiently to offer her
his arm to conduct her to the ball-room.</p>

<p>"Well, Cyril, what do you think of her?" Beatrix asked him
eagerly, as soon as she found a chance to hang upon his arm apart
from the rest.</p>

<p>He looked fondly down into the fair face.</p>

<p>"You must not be jealous of my opinion, my darling," he said.
"Of course you are the sweetest, fairest woman on earth to me. But
Mrs. Lynn is the most beautiful as well as the most gifted one I
ever met."</p>

<p>It was eloquent praise, but somehow Beatrix looked disappointed.
He read it plainly on the fair mobile face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there anything more that I ought to say about your favorite?"
he inquired, laughingly.</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed, no more to say about her?" she returned
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is something else&mdash;only I am afraid you will laugh
at the fancy, dear," said Cyril Wentworth, with a masculine dread
of ridicule.</p>

<p>"No, I will not laugh at you. Tell me," said Beatrix, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure you will not laugh," he said, "but I will
tell you the truth. Although I have never seen any one quite so
lovely as your Mrs. Lynn, yet she recalls to my mind some one else
whom I have met&mdash;indeed Beatrix, the resemblance is simply marvelous,"
he exclaimed, glancing across to where the lovely authoress
stood conversing with Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>"Whom does she resemble?" Beatrix inquired with her heart on
her lips.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will see the likeness as soon as I mention it," he
said. "Look closely at Mrs. Lynn, Beatrix&mdash;at her rare type of
beauty, her dark eyes, her golden hair, her blonde coloring, her delicately
chiseled features, her sweet, sad lips. She is like one long
dead. She is like Laurel Vane."</p>

<p>A sigh of relief came from her lips.</p>

<p>"I was sure you could not fail to see the resemblance," she said.</p>

<p>"So you had already noted it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Could one help it?" she whispered. "I will tell you a secret,
Cyril. I believe that this is Laurel Vane herself."</p>

<p>"But she is dead," Cyril objected, dazed by the suddenness of his
wife's revelation.</p>

<p>"I do not believe it. There has been some dreadful mistake. I
believe that St. Leon Le Roy's wife lives in the person of Mrs.
Lynn," exclaimed Beatrix, whispering to him earnestly for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>Laurel and Mr. Gordon, together with Mr. Ford, stood a little
apart watching the gay crowd of waltzers whirling down the center
of the long room to the measured beat of the gay dance music. She
did not know why she turned her head and looked in another direction,
but it must have been in magnetic obedience to an evil spell,
for in a moment she met the glance of Maud Merivale&mdash;Maud standing
near and leaning on the arm of a man who regarded her with
bold and eager eyes.</p>

<p>To have saved her life, Laurel could not have repressed that agitated
start, that tremor that shook her from head to foot at sight of
her old enemy's face! She had been proof against the softness of
love, the allurements of friendship, but in that instant the deadly influence
of fear and detestation sent a shudder through her frame and
blanched her lovely face to the pallor of death. It seemed as though
she was possessed by some horrible nightmare dream, as she met
those bold, evil eyes, and realized he recognized her as Laurel
Vane whom he had so relentlessly pursued with his evil designs.</p>

<p>With a terrible effort she turned her eyes from the villain's exultant
face, and they rested by chance on Beatrix, where she stood
leaning on her husband's arm. But whose was that other form beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Beatrix&mdash;that tall and stately presence? She gave a great gasp
of blended emotion&mdash;St. Leon Le Roy!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXII" id="CHAPTER_LXII">CHAPTER LXII.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon Le Roy&mdash;what had brought him here at this moment of
all others? What strange trick did fate mean to play her in thus
surrounding her all in a moment, as it were, with these people who
had had so malign an influence upon her past? Her heart beat with
deadly fear. One white, ringed hand furtively sought her uncle's
arm and clung to it as if to save herself from falling to the floor.
Through the wild rhythm of the dance music, through the measured
echo of the flying feet of the waltzers, she instinctively felt him pausing
before her&mdash;she heard Mrs. Wentworth's voice, saying, with a
strange, sweet ring in it:</p>

<p>"Mr. Le Roy, this is my dear friend, Mrs. Lynn."</p>

<p>Laurel could not speak for a moment. A deadly fear possessed
her. She heard a clear, calm, self-possessed voice saying, kindly:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynn and I have met before. We are neighbors at our
homes on the Hudson."</p>

<p>She did not look up, but she saw his strong, shapely white hand
held out to her, and as she laid her own within it, his gentle pressure
seemed to say dumbly:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, dear. They shall not surprise me into betraying
your strange secret."</p>

<p>Laurel could not speak for a moment. Happily, Beatrix broke
the silence by exclaiming, in a voice from which she could not keep
the ring of disappointment.</p>

<p>"Neighbors and acquaintances! And I did not dream that you
had met before!"</p>

<p>The whole fabric of the pretty romance she had been building up
was destroyed in a moment, like "the baseless fabric of a dream."
She felt like bursting into tears of disappointment. What beautiful
hopes she had built upon Mrs. Lynn's resemblance to Laurel Vane!
And oh, if Mr. Le Roy and the novelist could guess how she and her
father had plotted to bring them together, how angry they would be.
While these vexatious thoughts rushed over her, she heard Mrs.
Lynn saying in a cool, calm, almost indifferent voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Wentworth, my uncle's home on the Hudson adjoins
Eden. While we sojourned there this summer we had the pleasure
of meeting Mr. Le Roy and his mother."</p>

<p>And in the next breath Mr. Le Roy said, suavely:</p>

<p>"Will you give me this waltz, Mrs. Lynn?"</p>

<p>She laid her gloved hand on his arm, and they were whirled away
to the rhythm of the delicious waltz music. Who could tell how
quickly Laurel's heart beat as she "felt her true love's arm round
her once again"?</p>

<p>Beatrix, with her father and husband, stood gazing a little blankly
at the graceful forms of the handsome, well-matched pair. All
three were bitterly disappointed at the prosaic ending of the pretty
romance they had built up, and of which they had confidently expected
to behold the delightful <i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>But the most amazed of all were Mrs. Merivale, and her coadjutor
in malice, Ross Powell. They had stood near enough to witness
the meeting between Mr. Le Roy and Mrs. Lynn, and, while filled
with rage at the sight, they had been utterly confounded at the result.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy's cool declaration, "We have met before," Mrs.
Lynn's apparent calmness and <i>insouciance</i>, astounded them. They
looked into each other's eyes in wonder and amaze, and Ross Powell
asked, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"What, indeed?" she echoed. "Is the man blind, or are they
acting a part?"</p>

<p>He seized upon the idea quickly.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> acting a part," he said. "I could swear that Mrs.
Lynn is Laurel Vane, and, of course, her own husband could not be
deceived in her identity. Decidedly they are playing a part. But
why? Have you any idea?"</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," she replied. "And yet I would have the
world to know. Is he still angry with her? Is it possible he can
recognize her and not choose to claim her?"</p>

<p>"Is it possible that he is mad?" he asked, contemptuously. "No;
there is something deeper than that behind their masquerading.
Why, she is simply peerless! What man in his senses could behold
her and not claim her, knowing her his?"</p>

<p>The yearning in his voice made her bitterly angry. How she hated
that beauty that made men mad for her sake!&mdash;that satin-smooth
skin, those great, wine-dark eyes, that golden hair, that fire and soul
that made Mrs. Lynn so peerless, doubly crowned, doubly laureled
by both beauty and intellect!</p>

<p>"I thought you hated her!" she said, scornfully.</p>

<p>"So I do. I hate her and I love her in the same breath. Can
you understand the feeling?" he asked, hoarsely, and almost under
his breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," she answered, with subdued bitterness.</p>

<p>"The first sight of her lovely face stirred all the old passion within
me, and yet I hate her, too," he said, darkly. "I cannot bear
that that purse-proud aristocrat should win her back. I could sooner
bear to strike her dead at his feet than to see them happy together!"</p>

<p>He stood glowering at the graceful figure as it whirled down the
long ball-room in the clasp of St. Leon Le Roy's arm. All the worst
passions of his nature were roused by the sight. The first sight of
Laurel in all her womanly beauty had kindled anew the fires of his
passion for her, while his resentment at her scorn burned to fever
heat. He had spoken the truth when he said that he hated and
loved her in the same breath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merivale gazed at him with quickened breath and evilly
flashing eyes. She had set herself the deliberate task of arousing
all the worst instincts of this wicked and undisciplined nature.
Through Ross Powell she would have her revenge on those two
whom she hated. He was the blind instrument in her hands to work
out her wicked will.</p>

<p>"I do not blame you, Mr. Powell," she said, in a tone of gentlest
sympathy. "I know that men feel deeply and strongly on such
subjects, and I can imagine what it must be to see the woman one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
loves beloved by another man and loving him in return. It must almost
drive one to madness. It must be the refinement of torture."</p>

<p>"It is hell!" he muttered back, hoarsely, and with concentrated
bitterness and despair.</p>

<p>"It would be easier to see her dead, I fancy," pursued the wily
tempter, softly. "Death is a grim bridegroom, but better the gloom
of the grave than a hated bridegroom's arms!"</p>

<p>"You are right," he muttered; "I hate them both, and I swear
they shall not be happy together! What think you, Mrs. Merivale&mdash;is
there any chance of a reconciliation?"</p>

<p>"Look!" she answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Roy and Laurel had slipped out of the circle of dancers
and were leaving the ball-room arm in arm. Mrs. Merivale laughed
a hateful, significant laugh.</p>

<p>"They are going out on the shore," she said. "We all know the
romantic, softening influences of moonlight, music and love. They
will no longer be able to keep up the farce as strangers. They will
be melted by the soft influences of the night and fall into each
other's arms. Finis! reconciliation, renewed vows of love, beatific
happiness!"</p>

<p>Half maddened by her words, he ground his teeth over a fierce
and bitter oath, and shaking her hand from his arm, strode out of
the room with "the fires of hell" in his heart.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXIII" id="CHAPTER_LXIII">CHAPTER LXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Le Roy and Laurel had indeed gone out upon the shore. He
had invited her to do so, and she had complied, for she was full of
half-angry wonder as to what had brought him there. She was
frightened too, when she found herself surrounded by all those people
who belonged to her past. She asked herself if it could have
happened by simple chance. She was frightened. She felt like
some hunted creature brought to bay.</p>

<p>She tried to shake off her feelings of mingled terror and annoyance,
bravely assuring herself that there existed no cause for them.</p>

<p>"I have done nothing&mdash;these people have naught to do with me.
I am foolish to feel afraid when I see them all around me," she repeated
to herself.</p>

<p>When she tried to analyze her feelings, she found that it was only
Ross Powell who inspired her with such terror. She was not afraid
of Mrs. Merivale. She simply despised her; and, secure in her
fancied <i>incognito</i>, she did not feel apprehensive concerning the desire
of the jealous woman to work her ill. It was only Powell of
whom she felt afraid. His evil, exultant glance had assured her
that he knew her, and she had already had evidence of his willingness
to destroy every hope of her life so far as lay in his power. It
was wholly through dread of his haunting glance that she accepted
Mr. Le Roy's invitation to leave the crowded ball-room and go out
upon the shore; and once away from the baleful presence of the enemy
she feared and dreaded, she dismissed him wholly from her
thoughts, and gave herself up to the secret, trembling joy of St.
Leon's presence. Her heart was a traitor to her will. It exulted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
his nearness despite her reason, that told her they were better apart
if she meant to carry out her vow of pride and scorn.</p>

<p>She leaned upon his arm, and they walked silently through the
lovely moonlight down to the wave-washed shore. Laurel's heart
beat quick and fast against her husband's arm. The beauty of the
moonlight and the sea, the mellow notes of the dance-music, all had
their own effect upon her. Mrs. Merivale had rightly estimated
each as a softening influence. It was such a night as Emma Alice
Browne describes in her sweet poem, "The Bal-Masque."</p>

<span class="i1">Pulsed with the low, mellifluous beat<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of dimpling waves and dancing feet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>St. Leon looked down into the beautiful face that was so maddeningly
fair in the soft light, and his heart swelled with a great despair.
To think that she had once been his, that that peerless form
had rested in his arms, that sweet face slept upon his breast! And
now&mdash;divided by a woman's pride, they were as widely severed as
if Jean Ingelow's "vast, calm river, so dread to see," rolled its
rushing waves between their hearts.</p>

<p>Standing thus, arm in arm, each heart busy with its deep emotions,
neither heard the furtive steps creeping slowly up behind
them, neither saw the cruel, jealous face with its wild eyes glaring
upon them, neither saw the gleam of the slender dagger clutched in
the murderous hand, neither dreamed of the man who lurked behind
them, nor of the woman who followed at a safe distance, eager to
sate her vengeance in the sight of her rival's heart's blood.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynn, you are angry with me because I am here," said
St. Leon, half-questioningly.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, without removing her eyes from the moon-gilded
waves that broke at her feet in snowy surf. She felt too weak
to meet the mute pleading of those eyes she loved so madly.</p>

<p>"You think that I have followed you here," he went on, sadly.
"But you are wrong. Much as I might have wished to do so, dear
as your presence is to me, I could never&mdash;"</p>

<p>The deprecating words were never finished. A terrible form
flashed suddenly before them, a terrible face gleamed in the light
dagger flashed upward in the air, and a voice, hoarse with misery
and madness, rang out fiercely:</p>

<p>"Die, Laurel Vane&mdash;die!"</p>

<p>The dagger glittered against her snowy breast, the hand of the
frenzied madman would have driven it swiftly home but all in an
instant she was caught away, and the descending blade was sheathed
in another breast&mdash;the broad breast of St. Leon Le Roy. The arms
that had closed wildly around Laurel for a moment fell away from
her, and he dropped on the sands at her feet, the hot blood spurting
from his heart, and deepening the rosy hem of her satin robe to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
horrible crimson, while her agonized cry rent the summer night:
"Oh, St. Leon, you have died for me!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXIV" id="CHAPTER_LXIV">CHAPTER LXIV.</a></h2>


<p>"You have died for me!" the stricken wife repeated, and then,
overcome with horror, she knelt down beside the dead man, and
with her arms about him, and her head upon his breast, she relapsed
into unconsciousness almost as deep as death.</p>

<p>Ross Powell stood still a moment, like one frozen with horror.
That maddened cry from the lips of the woman he would have slain
rang fearfully in his ears, he realized in a moment to what fearful
lengths he had been driven by his own jealous passion and the specious
temptations of Mrs. Merivale. He had slain his hated rival,
but he had brought down retribution on his own head, for Laurel's
wild shriek of despair had echoed loudly back to the hotel, and already
a score of people were rushing to the scene. Startled, terrified,
the murderer made a wild rush forward, still clutching in his
hand the bloody dagger, but before he had run a dozen paces he
was brought to a stop by the sudden apparition of a white-faced
woman who flung herself wildly before him, hissing out, in tones
of blended wrath and horror, a terrible malediction upon his head:</p>

<p>"Murderer! you have slain <i>him</i>! How dared you, how dared
you? May Heaven's curses light upon your head! May you swing
from the hangman's rope! May perdition seize your soul!"</p>

<p>She must have been mad, for she flung herself before him, she
barred his way, she clung to him with her desperate white arms,
heedless of his curses and remonstrances, terribly intent on delivering
him up to justice, and so punishing him for the mad mistake he
had made in slaying the husband and sparing the wife!</p>

<p>She must have been mad, or she would have known that he would
not tamely submit to detention with the feet of the avengers gaining
swiftly on his track, and his soul writhing in horror of the hangman's
ghastly rope. He tried to thrust her from him, to tear away
from the arms that held him in desperate bondage; he shouted
hoarsely for her to let him go.</p>

<p>"Devil in woman's shape, it was you that tempted me!" he cried
out, with a fierce, blood-curling oath. "Now let me go, or I swear
I will kill you as I did him!"</p>

<p>She must have been mad, for she did not heed the threat&mdash;she
only clung the tighter in spite of his frantic struggles to release himself
from the arms that twined around him venomously, like living
serpents in the deadly embrace of hate.</p>

<p>"I will never let you go&mdash;never!" she hissed out, madly, and in
his frantic fear, hearing the steps of his pursuers coming nearer and
nearer on his trail, he lifted the cruel dagger, still reeking with Le
Roy's life-blood, and plunged it fiercely in her breast as it gleamed
bare and white in the beautiful moonlight.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she gasped, and the white arms relaxed their hold, her
body wavered and fell limply forward. He thrust it desperately
from him, and sprung forward&mdash;free!</p>

<p>Free! but at what terrible cost to his soul. The woman whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
low, soft whisperings had tempted him to murder, the woman who
in her madness would fain have delivered him up to the law's vengeance,
lay dead upon the shore, the cold, white moonlight shining
down into her ghastly, staring eyes and pallid face. Retribution
had overtaken her, and the fate she had plotted for another recoiled
upon her own head. The serpent she had loosed to destroy another
struck its deadly fangs into her own heart.</p>

<p>They lifted her up tenderly and pitifully, and bore her back to the
hotel. They spoke of her with the gentlest pity and regret as the
victim of a cruel murder, for no one ever knew the truth&mdash;no one
guessed that she was to blame for the tragedy that had ended her
life in so disastrous a fashion. The shadow of her sin never rested
on her grave, for there was no one to betray her&mdash;Ross Powell was
never apprehended. His deadly fear lent wings to his feet, and he
escaped from his pursuers and made good his flight to a far-off land.
He never returned to his native shore, he was never brought to
justice. All his punishment came to him through his own coward
conscience. The cruel whip-lash of remorse followed him through
the world. The double murder he had committed lay like a mountain's
weight upon his soul. He had been bad and wicked, but of
his own self he would never have committed murder. He had been
goaded into its commission by a temporary madness, and in time he
repented most sincerely of his sin, and died in the humble hope of
forgiveness by a merciful Redeemer.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXV" id="CHAPTER_LXV">CHAPTER LXV.</a></h2>


<p>And Laurel?</p>

<p>Full of wonder and pity and sympathy, they lifted the golden
head from Le Roy's breast, and bore her away. No one dreamed
that he had given his life to save hers. No one dreamed that she
belonged to him by the dearest tie possible to mortals: no one knew
that her rightful place was by his side, and the sealed lips did not
open to claim her right, for they were pale and rigid as if the finger
of eternal silence had been laid upon them.</p>

<p>Strangers' hands carried her back to the hotel, and the news of
the dreadful tragedy spread far and wide. It excited the greatest
wonder. It was so sudden, so strange, so mysterious. No one
knew the murderer, and no one guessed the motive for his double
crime&mdash;no one except, perhaps, Mr. Gordon, and he was wisely
silent. He deemed it for the best.</p>

<p>But it created a great sensation. Mr. Le Roy was so well known
as a gentleman of birth, culture, and wealth, and Mrs. Merivale as
a woman of fashion, that the wonder and excitement were most intense.
Popular indignation ran high against Ross Powell. If they
had caught him, it is most probable that Judge Lynch would have
been his executioner.</p>

<p>The sensation had its element of romance. It was whispered far
and near that the beautiful belle, Mrs. Lynn, had fainted with her
head upon Mr. Le Roy's breast. They told how her delicate laces
had been crimsoned by his life blood, how she had looked like a
dead woman when they lifted her up. When it became known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
next day, that her excitement had culminated in an attack of brain
fever, the interest and sympathy and curiosity ran higher and
higher. People agreed that there must have been something between
Mr. Le Roy and Mrs. Lynn. They deemed that they had
been lovers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wentworth did not return to New York the next day. She
remained to nurse her ill and unconscious friend. Cyril Wentworth
stayed also. Mr. Gordon went back, and brought his wife down to
see her daughter. She was very willing to forgive her now. Years
had softened her anger and resentment, and when she heard that
Cyril Wentworth had proved himself worthy of her beautiful
daughter she threw pride to the winds and forgave him, too. They
had a very tender reconciliation&mdash;the mother and daughter&mdash;in the
quiet room where Laurel lay ill unto death with brain fever, her
beautiful golden hair cut close to her head, and cold, sparkling ice
laid against the fevered brain to cool the subtle fire that burned in
her veins.</p>

<p>Beatrix told her mother all that she suspected&mdash;that Mrs. Lynn
was Laurel Le Roy&mdash;and Mrs. Gordon quite agreed with her. She
had never forgotten the beautiful face of the girl who had deceived
St. Leon Le Roy so bitterly. She recalled it again now, and she
was sure that her daughter was right. There could not have been
two such lovely faces in the world. She did not doubt that this
was St. Leon's wife.</p>

<p>She forgave Laurel now for all that she had done. It was easy to
forgive her now, when she lay so ill&mdash;perhaps dying. She and
Beatrix vied with each other in the care of the invalid. They would
not trust her wholly to the care of a hired nurse. Her life was too
precious. Laurence and Trixy were left to the care of the nurses,
and Beatrix gave all her care and thought to the invalid.</p>

<p>"I cannot do too much for her," said gentle Beatrix. "She was
like an angel to me."</p>

<p>The day came at last when her patience and fidelity were rewarded.
Laurel opened her eyes and looked up with the light of
reason shining in her face. The crisis of her terrible delirium was
past. She would recover.</p>

<p>She looked at Beatrix, and a faint flush stole into her pale face.</p>

<p>"Have I told all in my delirium?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You have told nothing. All your ravings have been of your
books and of your child," Beatrix answered, gently.</p>

<p>A look of anxiety stole into the hollow, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"My little Laurie?" she said, wistfully.</p>

<p>"He is well and happy. He has been well cared for," answered
Beatrix. "But I must not bring him to you yet; you are not strong
enough. Can you wait?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can wait," Laurel answered, patiently. Then she laid
her thin, white hand on Beatrix's arm. "Can you forgive me?"
she said. "I have been hard and proud and wicked. I have willfully
deceived you; I am really Laurel Vane."</p>

<p>Beatrix bent and kissed the poor, pale lips that faltered over this
humble confession.</p>

<p>"My dear, I have known it all the while," she said, simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you forgive me for my duplicity?" asked Laurel, in
wonder.</p>

<p>"My dear, if you can forgive me all the sorrow my willful plot
brought down upon your head, there is nothing I cannot forgive
you," cried impulsive Beatrix.</p>

<p>"You were not to blame," Laurel answered, and the warm color
drifted over her face as she went on, sadly: "It was all the fault of
my mad love, Beatrix. I blame no one for my folly and sin. If
I had gone away from Eden with Clarice Wells, nothing would
have happened. I stayed, and brought down fate upon my own
head&mdash;and his."</p>

<p>"A happy fate, my dear, if only you will be reconciled to him,"
said Beatrix, gently.</p>

<p>The dark eyes looked up at her, full of the pathos of regret and
despair.</p>

<p>"Ah! now I understand all the pathos that lies in those words,
<i>too late</i>," she said. "I was mad, I think&mdash;mad with my wounded
love and pride. I denied my identity to him, I refused to listen to
his repentance, I was cruelly hard and cold; and now my punishment
has come. I repent, but he cannot hear me. My love cannot reach
him, for he is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead! ah, no, my dear! Is it possible that you have been
thinking so? He lives, he will soon be well and strong again if
only you will forgive him."</p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly, for Laurel's head had fallen back,
her eyes were closed. The shock of joy had been too much. Laurel
had quietly fainted.</p>

<p>When she came to herself again there was a strange resolute look
in the dark eyes. She took Beatrix's hand and held it tightly in
both her own as if she needed strength and support.</p>

<p>"He lives," she said, wildly. "Oh, how glad I am! Now I
will make atonement to him! He would have given his life to save
mine. I will give him more than my life."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," said Beatrix, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"You shall know soon," said Laurel. "Dear Beatrix, do let me
have Laurie a little while. I am sure it will not hurt me. I am
stronger than you think!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVI" id="CHAPTER_LXVI">CHAPTER LXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Beatrix did not know how to refuse the mother's prayer. She
knew that Laurel's heart was yearning for the child, and she did
not really think that it would do her any injury to see him. She
made her promise that she would not excite herself, and then she
went after the little lad who was as usual at play with Trixy upon
the shore.</p>

<p>She made Laurence promise that he would be very gentle and
quiet in his mamma's room, and he very readily agreed to do so.
She knew that he was a little gentleman who would keep his word
of honor, and so she sent him in and waited outside patiently until
that momentous interview was over.</p>

<p>Laurel kept the child almost an hour. No one knew just what
she said to him or how much of the past she revealed to him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the boy came out with a face all glowing with joy and sought little
Trixy.</p>

<p>To her he confided his joyous news:</p>

<p>"I have a real, live papa, Trixy. He is not dead as we thought.
He is good and handsome&mdash;as handsome as your papa, Trixy, dear,
and when mamma gets well she is going to take me to him."</p>

<p>Trixy was delighted at the good fortune that had befallen her
boy lover. It formed an inexhaustible theme with them. They
discussed it daily and compared notes on their papas in the most
earnest fashion. Laurence was very impatient to have his mamma
get well. The vague longing that had haunted him all his lifetime
would be realized when he went home to that splendid papa whom
already he loved in anticipation.</p>

<p>Laurel convalesced very fast. Since she had heard that her husband
still lived, there was a great change in her. She was very
grave and thoughtful, even amounting to sadness. Beatrix could
not understand her. She was fonder than ever of her child; but
there seemed to be a sort of passionate sorrow mingled with her
love. She would fondle and caress him, and then she would weep
bitterly over him.</p>

<p>"Why do you weep over your child?" Beatrix asked her, in
wonder.</p>

<p>"I love him so dearly," answered Laurel, evasively.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why that should be a reason for weeping
over him. You ought to be quite happy over such a beautiful boy,"
said impulsive Beatrix, sighing, as she thought of her own little lad
sleeping far away beneath the skies of England.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> happy over him," said Laurel. "But, oh, Beatrix, you
do not quite understand me. Hitherto my little Laurence has belonged
only to me. He came to me in a dark and troublous time,
when I was alone and friendless in the world. I worked for him,
I made money for him, and I filled up the void in my heart with
his baby-love. But for him I should have died. I could not have
borne my life. And now we shall be parted, I and my little son.
I shall give him to his father; but, oh, Beatrix, what shall I do
without him?"</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you, indeed, Laurel," said simple Beatrix.
"You are going home to your husband, are you not, dear? Surely
you will not mind dividing the child's love with him. Think how
selfishly you have kept it to yourself all these years, and you will
not lose him or be parted from him. You know what the poet
says: 'Half is his, and half is thine.' Depend upon it, Laurel, you
will be happier in the child's love when his father shares it. It is
only natural that you should be."</p>

<p>"You will understand my meaning better in a little while, dear
Beatrix," Laurel answered, gently, and then she abruptly changed
the subject.</p>

<p>"I have always wanted to ask you about Clarice Wells," she said.
"What has become of her?"</p>

<p>Beatrix laughed, sweetly and gayly.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have not forgotten Clarice," she said. "She
was a good girl, and she admired you very much. I was sorry to
lose her when I left England, but I could not forbid the bans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is married, then?" asked Laurel.</p>

<p>"Yes, and her marriage was quite romantic. Should you like to
hear about it?"</p>

<p>"Very much," Laurel replied.</p>

<p>"You would scarcely believe it of one so devoted to the laws of
Caste, and who lectured you so roundly for aspiring above your
station, but Clarice is actually the wife of an English baronet,"
laughed Beatrix, "and it all happened in the most romantic fashion.
I always thought that Clarice had a spice of romance in her nature.
She betrayed it when she lent herself so readily to the furtherance
of our girlish conspiracy."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Laurel.</p>

<p>"She met him&mdash;her baronet&mdash;in the Alps, where we were taking
our little summer holidays," continued Beatrix. "He was summering
there, too, and 'they met by chance&mdash;the usual way,' you
know, Laurel. She saved his life&mdash;he was rolling down a precipice
and she adroitly caught him back&mdash;she was always a quick-witted
little thing. Well, he was grateful, she was interested, and, next
thing, they fell in love. Clarice was very sensible at first. She
refused to have anything to say to him, and I applauded her. But,
really, Laurel, it was not so bad. He was not, 'to the manner
born.' Until a year before he had been plain John Bull, a briefless
barrister. He had succeeded to the baronetage by a series of accidental
and unexpected deaths of heirs-presumptive, and he was
plain and sensible, and forty years old at least."</p>

<p>"I do not think his age was any objection," cried Laurel, hastily,
and blushing very much.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, and it did not prove so in this case," smiled Beatrix.
"He would not take her No for an answer. He never rested
until he made pretty Clarice 'my lady.'"</p>

<p>"It is very romantic. I shall make it a plot for a novel," declared
Laurel. "I dare say Clarice would not scold me now for
aspiring above my station," she added, with a pretty, pensive smile.</p>

<p>"I dare say not," said Beatrix, greatly amused. "Exceptions
alter cases."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVII" id="CHAPTER_LXVII">CHAPTER LXVII.</a></h2>


<p>In five weeks after that tragedy at the seashore Laurel announced
her intention of returning to Belle Vue. She had convalesced very
rapidly, and the bloom and beauty of health were fast returning to
her lovely face. Nothing was left to remind one of her almost fatal
illness save the short, soft rings of sunny hair that clustered all over
the beautiful, graceful head. Beatrix grieved sorely over the loss
of that wealth of golden tresses from her friend's head, but after
all it scarcely detracted from Laurel's beauty. The pretty, babyish
ringlets lent a <i>spirituelle</i> charm to the fair face and made a halo
about the brow that made her "half of earth and half divine."</p>

<p>"Let us go home to Belle Vue," she said, pleadingly, to her uncle
and he eager to gratify her slightest wish, consented. They wished
to have Beatrix and her mother go with them, but they excused
themselves and promised to come later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"When Laurel has left you and you feel lonely," said Mrs. Gordon,
with a smile.</p>

<p>The beautiful authoress blushed vividly and then grew very pale.
She made no answer to the half question. No one quite knew what
she intended to do. No one could understand her, she was so shy,
so reticent, she blushed so at the slightest mention of Mr. Le Roy's
name.</p>

<p>But Beatrix, as she held her in her arms at parting, whispered,
pleadingly, against her cheek:</p>

<p>"You will not be hard and unforgiving any longer, dear. You
will go home to him?"</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me in a few days," Laurel answered; and
Beatrix was obliged to be content with that ambiguous reply.</p>

<p>They went back to Belle Vue. The autumn days had set in now,
and the trees were clothed in all the glory of their autumn coloring.
From hill to hill, from shore to shore glowed with scarlet and brown
and gold. The sun shone still with all the brightness of summer,
the flowers were in their glory yet. There was no cloud in all the
summer sky that morning when Laurel went shyly up to her uncle's
side.</p>

<p>"Uncle Carlyle, I want you to take me over to Eden this morning,"
she said, with the beautiful blushes mantling on her cheeks.</p>

<p>He drew the back of his hand hastily across his eyes. The hour
for which he had longed and dreaded had come. He was going to
lose Laurel and his darling little Laurie.</p>

<p>"My dear, are you strong enough?" he asked her, wistfully.
"Remember, we only came to Belle Vue yesterday."</p>

<p>"I am so restless&mdash;it seems as if I cannot wait," she said, and he
saw that the dark eyes were full of unrest and pain.</p>

<p>"We will go at once, dear," he said; and though he did not say
another word, Laurel understood why he took her so tenderly in his
arms and kissed her. She did not speak. Her heart was too full
for words.</p>

<p>They took little Laurence and drove over to Eden. Mr. Ford sent
in his card alone to Mrs. Le Roy, and they waited silently in the
grand drawing-room for her. But when he heard her coming he
withdrew into the shadow of the curtained bay-window. He did
not wish to embarrass her meeting with Laurel by his presence.</p>

<p>The door opened and she entered slowly with a step that had grown
unconsciously feeble and halting. The fine old face looked pale and
sad, there was a sorrowful droop about the delicate lips. The years
that had brought Laurel to the perfection of her womanly beauty
had sadly aged St. Leon's mother.</p>

<p>She came in sadly enough, but when she saw who her visitors
were the light of a sudden, tremulous hope flashed over her proud,
sad face. Her dim eyes brightened.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lynn!" she exclaimed, wonderingly.</p>

<p>The beautiful woman in the white dress with the crimson roses
fastened against her round white throat rose and went hastily forward.
There was a look of pain and shame on the fair face.</p>

<p>"Do not call me by that name. It never was mine. It has only
been the mask beneath which I hoped to hide my identity," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Laurel. "I am ashamed and penitent now. Call me, Laurel,
mother, and say that you forgive me."</p>

<p>"Laurel, I am so glad!" cried Mrs. Le Roy, throwing her arms
about her neck, and then with the charming inconsistency of woman
she wept.</p>

<p>She had forgotten the child in her joy at the restoration of Laurel,
but suddenly a little hand stole into hers, and a half-expostulating
voice said:</p>

<p>"Grandmamma!"</p>

<p>She turned and caught the beautiful boy to her heart, half-smothering
him in her fond caresses.</p>

<p>"My precious little grandchild," she cried; and Laurence asked
her <i>naïvely</i>:</p>

<p>"If you are glad that we have come home, mamma and me, why
do you cry?"</p>

<p>"You must not ask questions, my little lad," said Mr. Ford, coming
forward and greeting his hostess, and thinking to himself that
she had suddenly grown beautiful in the radiance of the joy-light
that beamed upon her face.</p>

<p>He asked the question that Laurel was too timid to syllable upon
her lips.</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Le Roy?"</p>

<p>"He has had a relapse&mdash;he is quite unwell to-day," Mrs. Le Roy
said, tremulously. "He has been very ill since we brought him
from the seashore. He makes no effort to recover. He does not
seem to care to live."</p>

<p>She looked at Laurel as she spoke.</p>

<p>"It is all your fault, dear!" she said, gently. "Life has never
been the same since you were lost to him. Only this morning the
physician told me that without some object in life, something more
to live for than he has now, my son would never get well."</p>

<p>Laurel's face was very pale. She drew her arm tightly around
her son as he stood by her side. "May I&mdash;see him?" she asked, in
a faint, trembling voice, without lifting her eyes.</p>

<p>"He is in his own room, dear. Go to him as soon as you please,"
Mrs. Le Roy answered, gladly.</p>

<p>Laurel did not wait for another word. They saw that she was
very pale, that she trembled very much, and their hearts went out
to her in silent sympathy for her suffering. She rose, took her little
son by the hand, and silently left the room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVIII" id="CHAPTER_LXVIII">CHAPTER LXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>St. Leon Le Roy lay among the lace-fringed pillows of his luxurious
bed that morning alone and lonely.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful room where he lay, but the invalid took no
pleasure in it. It was large and lofty, with a lovely painted ceiling,
and the walls were hung in beautiful draperies of rose-hued silk and
snowy lace. The furniture and carpet were upholstered in pink velvet,
the carpet had a pattern of roses upon it, the vases on the marble
mantel were filled with exquisite flowers. St. Leon had been surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
by beautiful things all his life. They did not add to his
pleasures nor detract from his pain.</p>

<p>He lay there wearily among the downy pillows, with his wasted
white hand over his heavy eyes, and his thoughts fixed on the beautiful
wife, so fatally lost to him. Only that morning the physician
had warned him.</p>

<p>"You must rouse yourself, Le Roy, or you will die from the
effects of your terrible wound. The strain upon your system has
been most severe. I have exhausted my art in bringing you to the
point of convalescence. Now, you must help yourself. If you give
way to this fit of despondency, this <i>ennui</i> that I see creeping upon
you, I will not answer for the consequences. You must rally from
this spell of dejection. Make yourself an object in life, and live
for it."</p>

<p>Then he went away. He had done all he could for the suffering
body; he did not know how to minister to a mind diseased. He had
detected the symptoms, but St. Leon alone could apply the remedy.</p>

<p>He lay silently thinking.</p>

<p>There was only one object for which he could have cared to live,
and that was unattainable. Why should he exert himself to hold on
to a life that was scarce worth living? Why not let go the anchor
and drift idly with the tide that dashed him hither and thither on its
restless waves? Who would greatly care to live when all of life had
grown into a long regret?</p>

<p>His door unclosed softly, but he did not turn his head. He knew
that his mother had had visitors, and he supposed that she was now
returning. He did not look at her&mdash;he knew that she could not bear
to see the heavy sadness in his eyes.</p>

<p>A light step stole across the floor, and saying to himself, "She
thinks me asleep," he gently closed his eyes. It was a harmless deception
he often practiced upon her. Thinking him asleep, she
would feel more content.</p>

<p>"Papa!" said a proud, happy little voice, and a soft hand fluttered
down upon his own.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes with a start.</p>

<p>A child was standing beside him&mdash;a beautiful boy, with hair and
eyes like his own, and his mother's wistful smile&mdash;Laurence Lynn!</p>

<p>"Laurie!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I have come home to you. I am your son&mdash;really
and truly. Are you not glad?" cried the child, who had been so
loved and petted all his life that it was no vanity in him to imagine
that any one must be proud and glad in possession of him.</p>

<p>Glad! St. Leon could not speak for a moment. He was dazed
with the suddenness of the surprise.</p>

<p>He threw his arm about his son, and strained him to his heart; but
his thoughts were with the mother more than the child.</p>

<p>"Did you come alone, dear?" he asked, as soon as he could command
his voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; mamma and Uncle Carlyle came with me. Mamma!"&mdash;he
suddenly looked around, then broke from St. Leon's clasp and
ran to the door&mdash;"mamma, come back!" he called. "Why did you
run away?"</p>

<p>St. Leon leaned on his elbow and watched the door impatiently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
his breath coming and going in great strangling gasps&mdash;his heart full
of trembling anticipation.</p>

<p>"What does it mean? Will she forgive me? Will she come back
to me?" he asked himself, in a bewildering maze of hope and anxiety.</p>

<p>Laurie opened the door and ran out into the hall. He came back
in a moment, and before he entered St. Leon heard the echo of a
loved, familiar footstep beside that of the child. The color rushed
into his face. His heart beat tumultuously.</p>

<p>"Why did you run away, mamma?" the child was still repeating
as they came across the threshold hand in hand.</p>

<p>St. Leon had heard that she had been very ill after the shock of
his supposed death that dreadful night. He had drawn some hopeful
auguries from the news at first. Perhaps she loved him still,
perhaps she would relent and come back to him. But he had waited
so long for a sign from her that he had fallen into despair again.
The sight of her now, as she came into the room, revived the dying
embers of hope within his breast.</p>

<p>To his fond, adoring eyes she had never looked more lovely despite
the closely cut curls and the extreme pallor of her face. She
came across the floor holding the child by the hand, and as she met
the imploring gaze of his eyes her own seemed to swim in a fine glittering
mist of unshed tears. She stood there silently a moment, and
he waited humbly to hear her speak&mdash;to pronounce his doom, as it
were, for it seemed to him that fate itself hung on those tender,
wistful lips. In that moment of passionate suspense and longing it
seemed to him that he experienced something of the feelings that
must have thrilled her that terrible night when she had prayed him
for forgiveness and he had coldly put her away.</p>

<p>"It is retribution," he said to himself, while the cold dew of
agony beaded his brow.</p>

<p>She was holding Laurie's hand tightly clasped within her own.
Once, twice, she raised it to her lips, then suddenly she laid it quickly
in St. Leon's palm and withdrew her own. Her voice had a
strange, almost dying sound as she said:</p>

<p>"You saved my life, St. Leon. Ay, you did more&mdash;you would
have given your life for mine! Do not think me ungrateful. Do
not believe that I could forget what I owe you. I am come to make
reparation. You would have given me your life. See! I give you
what is dearer than my life to me&mdash;the heir to Eden!"</p>

<p>Then she stepped back into the shadow. She did not wish him to
see the white agony that was written on her face. She would make
the sacrifice bravely, not showing him all that it cost her bleeding
heart.</p>

<p>He drew one arm around the child and held him to his breast. He
kept the other free. His eyes turned wistfully to that fair, sad face,
half veiled by the falling curtain.</p>

<p>"Laurel," he breathed.</p>

<p>There was a world of tenderness, passion, and entreaty in his tone.
Her heart beat wildly. She turned toward him, trying to look calm
and brave.</p>

<p>He held out his other arm to her, but she would not understand.
She gazed at him in silent distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Laurel," he said again, "the gift would not be complete without
you. Are you not coming to me, too, dear?"</p>

<p>The swift color rushed into her face, her great dark eyes brimmed
over with tears, but she stood quite still, she would not stir.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXIX" id="CHAPTER_LXIX">CHAPTER LXIX.</a></h2>


<p>She did not stir, she did not speak. The tears brimmed over and
rolled down her cheeks, but she kept her place in silence.</p>

<p>"Will you not come to me?" he pleaded, and she answered then,
drearily:</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"You cannot! Oh, Laurel, do not say so!" he cried. "What is
to hinder you from coming back to my heart? What can stand between
us?"</p>

<p>"Your own words," she answered, brushing the tears away, and
gazing at him with eyes full of somber misery and pain.</p>

<p>He was full of wonder and perplexity.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you," he said. "I would give the world
to have you back again, Laurel. I love you with the most faithful
love the world ever knew. I shall never cease to love you!"</p>

<p>"Yet once you said&mdash;surely you remember it, St. Leon?&mdash;that you
could never again love a woman who had deceived you. Once fallen
from its pedestal, the broken idol could never be restored again."</p>

<p>The words came back to his memory&mdash;the words he had spoken
before he <i>knew</i>&mdash;the words that were all that stood between them
now.</p>

<p>He looked at her in anguish. He would have given anything if
only he had never made that vain boast&mdash;how vain he had never
known till now.</p>

<p>"I was foolish and mad and blind," he cried. "It was the most
empty boast the world ever knew. Oh, Laurel, will you not forgive
me for my hardness and cruelty?"</p>

<p>She stood still, with her small hands folded before her, her fair
head drooping low, as she answered:</p>

<p>"I do forgive you."</p>

<p>"Then you will come back to me! You will not be hard upon
me, Laurel, I have repented so bitterly. I repented within twenty-four
hours after I had put you away from me so hardly. All my
life since we parted, has been one long repentance, my darling."</p>

<p>"I did not come back for this, St. Leon," she said, tremulously;
"I meant only to give you the child. I thought I should go away
then."</p>

<p>Little Laurence uttered a startled cry. He wrenched himself loose
from his father's clasp, and ran to her to hide his face in the soft
white folds of her dress.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, vehemently, "I cannot stay with papa unless
you will stay, too, mamma. I love you the best!"</p>

<p>St. Leon looked at his wife. She shrunk a little before that look.
It was sadly reproachful.</p>

<p>"You see how it is," he said. "You have kept him from me
all his life, and now he has no love to give me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>But the child interposed, vehemently:</p>

<p>"I love you both, and I will stay with you both. Only mamma
must not go away from Eden."</p>

<p>He drew her forward impulsively as he spoke. He placed her
hand in her husband's, and closed his own little dimpled fingers
around them, so that Laurel could not draw hers away.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I love you first and best," he said. "But I love papa
and grandmamma, too. If he has been naughty, let us forgive him
and stay with him."</p>

<p>"Stay with me, Laurel," echoed St. Leon.</p>

<p>She felt the warm, persuasive clasp of his fingers on hers. All the
ice about her heart melted beneath that touch. She could not hold
out against him. She knew that she must yield if she did not fly
from his presence.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me go!" she cried. "It is not best that I should come
back to you. It is the child you want. There is so much in the
past that would haunt us! There is so much to rouse reproach and
regret. We are best apart. Oh, let me go!"</p>

<p>But somehow he had drawn her down to the clasp of his arms
now. His warm lips were pressed against her cheek.</p>

<p>"Only one word, dear," he whispered. "Do you love me still,
my Laurel?"</p>

<p>"I have loved you always," she murmured, and she knew that
with this confession love had conquered pride.</p>

<p>"Then let us forget all else but our love," he pleaded. "You
will stay with me, Laurel?"</p>

<p>"I will stay," she answered.</p>
